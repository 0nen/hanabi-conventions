# Intermediate Guide for the Hyphen-ated Group

* Have you already read the [beginner's guide](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Beginner.md) and are looking to learn more? If not, go back and read that, and then wait a little while for that information to digest before coming back here.
* The intermediate guide is currently under development. Until it is finished, please skim through the sections in the [reference document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md) for "Level 2". Know that you can safely ignore all of the other sections until you have hundreds of games and start to get really good!
