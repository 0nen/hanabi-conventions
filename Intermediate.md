# Intermediate Guide for the Hyphen-ated Group

* Have you already read the [beginner's guide](Beginner.md) and are looking to learn more? If not, go back and read that, and then wait a little while for that information to digest before coming back here. (Hanabi can be pretty complicated, so reading too much too fast will only leave you confused, especially if you don't have a lot of in-game experience with what you know so far.)
* We don't currently have an intermediate guide. Until we decide what we want to put in it, you can skim through the sections in the [reference document](Reference.md) for "Level 2". Know that you can safely ignore the other sections until you have hundreds of games and start to get really good!
