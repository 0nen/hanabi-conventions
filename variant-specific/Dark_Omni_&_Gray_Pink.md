# Specific Conventions for Dark Omni & Gray Pink

These conventions apply to any variant with a dark omni suit or a gray pink suit.

<br />

### Pseudo Saves

* Dark omni or gray pink cards on chop should be saved with number 5 clue. *Pink Promise* does not apply in this variant.

### Pseudo-Rank Saves

* In situations where there are critical cards behind dark omni or gray pink cards, you are also allowed to *Fake Save* with any number (either 2, 3, or 4). (Again, *Pink Promise* does not apply to this variant.)
