# Specific Conventions for Pink

These conventions apply to any variant with a pink (touched by all ranks) suit.

<br />

### Good Touch Principle

* Due to the nature of pink cards being touched by a lot of different kinds of clues, they are a bit easier to duplicate than a normal suit, or even a rainbow suit.
* However, just like any other suit, *Good Touch Principle* applies to pink cards. Players should 1) do their best to not duplicate pink cards and 2) assume by default that the remaining pink cards in their hand are "good".

### Pink Tempo Clues

* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a pink card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get pink cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.

### Pink Promise

* When a pink card is given a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue* with a number, the number must match the true identity of the card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Cathy has a pink 2 on chop followed by a blue 5.
  * Alice and Bob need to give a *Save Clue* to both the pink 2 and the blue 5.
  * If Alice gave a number 5 clue, it would save both of the cards in one fell swoop, since a number 5 clue would touch the pink 2.
  * However, doing that would break the *Pink Promise*, since once Cathy learns that her slot 5 card is a pink card, she will always assume that it is a pink 5.
  * Thus, Alice gives a number 2 clue as a *2 Save* on the pink 2, and then Bob clues a number 5 clue as a *5 Save* on the blue 5.

### The Pink Prompt Rank Exception

* Normally, *Prompts* take precedence over *Finesses*. This means that if a card in a player's hand has one or more positive clues on it that "match", they should never blind-play their *Finesse Position* and instead play their left-most clued card.
* This rule does **not** apply to potential pink cards that only have a single rank clue on them (and the rank on them does not match the rank of the promised card). In this situation, players should prefer playing their *Finesse Position* instead of playing the clued card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues pink to Cathy, touching a pink 4 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob's slot 2 card and slot 3 card have a single number 4 clue of them (and no other clues).
  * Bob knows that he is promised the pink 3. Technically, the pink 3 could be his slot 2 card, and *Prompts* normally take precedence over *Finesses*.
  * However, Bob also knows that *Prompts* do not apply to pink cards with a rank mismatch. This is currently the case for him since he is promised a 3 and his clued card has a number 4 clue on it.
  * Thus, Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as pink 3.

### The Pink Play Clue Lie (with multiple 1's)

* Players can violate *Pink Promise* with a number 1's clue if all of the cards will successfully play.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching a red 1 on slot 1, a pink 3 on slot 2, a pink 2 on slot 3, and a pink 1 on slot 4.
  * Bob knows that from *Good Touch Principle*, all of his 1's are good, so now he can play all of them from right to left.
  * Bob plays the pink 1 from slot 4.
  * On his next turn, Bob plays the pink 2 from slot 3. Bob is immediately surprised that this is not a real 1, but he knows that this kind of thing is allowed and that he should continue to play his remaining 1's.
  * On his next turn, Bob plays the pink 3 from slot 2. Bob is again surprised that this is not a real 1, but he knows that this kind of thing is allowed and that he should continue to play his final 1.
  * On his next turn, Bob plays the red 1 from slot 1.

### The Pink Play Clue Lie (with a mismatched *Play Clue* that touches other cards)

* Players can also violate *Pink Promise* if they are giving a *Play Clue* and the lie will be resolved when the player who is clued plays their focused card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Pink 3 and and red 2 are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Cathy, touching a pink 4 on slot 1 and a blue 3 on slot 2.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy plays the card on slot 1, thinking that it is a red 3. It is actually the pink 4.
  * Cathy knows that Alice broke *Pink Promise* and that she was lied to, but that it was a *Pink Play Clue Lie*. Cathy knows that Alice likely did things this way because she wanted a 2-for-1 (to pick up some useful 3 "for free") instead of just a 1-for-1 on just the pink 4.

### No Order Chop Moves

* At the beginning of the game, when you get a clue that touches multiple 1's, you are supposed to play them from right-to-left (in exactly in the same way that you would in a no variant game).
* Players are not allowed to *Order Chop Move*, because they could be misplaying a pink card. (See the following two sections, which are related.)

### Pink Fix Clues (on 1's)

* Normally, when someone receives a number 1 clue that touches a bunch of 1's, they will play all of those 1's from right to left.
* If a subsequent clue "fills in" one of the 1s to be a pink card, then the player will **not** play that card anymore (because it could just be any pink card in the game).
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1's in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  * Bob plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice discards.
  * Bob plays slot 2, and it is a blue 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Bob, touching a 5 on his chop as a *5 Save*. This also "fills in" the 1 to be a pink card.
  * Bob knows that the pink card in his hand *could* be a pink 1. However, it could also be any other pink card in the game. Bob knows that when 1's are filled in to be pink, they should not be played anymore.

### Pink Fix Promise (on a 1 that is going to play)

* Normally, *Pink Promise* only applies when a pink card is the focus of a clue.
* However, as an exception, *Pink Promise* also applies in the situation where a bunch of 1's are clued and then one of the 1's is "filled in" as pink card to stop it from being played as a 1.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Alice clues number 1 to Bob, touching three 1's in slot 1, slot 2, and slot 3.
  * Bob plays slot 3 and it is a red 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice discards.
  * Bob plays slot 2, and it is a blue 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Bob, touching a 3 on his chop. This also "fills in" the 1 to be a pink card.
  * Bob knows that the pink card in his hand could technically be a pink 1. However, Bob also knows that when 1's are filled in to be pink, they should not be played anymore.
  * Thus, Bob knows that the point of Alice's clue was a *Fix Clue* to stop him from playing the pink card. The 3 on his chop could be any 3 in the game. Furthermore, Bob knows that *Pink Promise* applies to this *Fix Clue* and that his pink card should be exactly *Pink 3*.
* As an exception, *Pink Fix Promise* does **not** apply when the *Fix Clue* is a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue and the newly introduced card was on chop. An example of this can be found in the previous section, "Pink Fix Clues (on 1's)". (In this example, Bob's pink card is not necessarily a pink 5; it can be any pink card in the game.)

### Pink Choice Tempo Clue

* When one or more pink cards are retouched with a pink clue, the interpretation should be as normal: play the cards from left to right as a *Tempo Clue* (or a *Double Tempo Clue*).
* When one or more pink cards are retouched with a rank clue, and there are no "new" cards introduced (or, if the only "new" cards introduced are trash), then extra information can be conveyed by what rank is chosen.
* The rank chosen should correspond to the slot that they should play.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Bob has two pink cards clued in his hand on slot 3 and slot 4. He does not know the rank of either card.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Bob, which touches both pink cards and nothing else.
  * Bob knows that a rank 4 clue means to play slot 4, so he plays his right-most pink card.
  * Bob holds on to the other pink card for later, knowing that the *Pink Choice Tempo Clue* only "gets" one card.

### The Pink Choice Finesse

* The concept of *Pink Choice* can also be used to initiate a *Finesse* on a pink card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * No cards are played on the stacks.
  * Cathy has a clued pink 3 in slot 3 and a clued pink 2 in slot 4. She does not know the rank of either card.
  * Alice clues number 4 to Cathy, which touches both pink cards and nothing else.
  * Bob knows that a number 4 clue means to play slot 4, so the pink 2 must be playable right now. Bob plays his *Finesse Position* card as pink 1.
  * Cathy plays the pink 2 from slot 4.

### Pink Fix Clues (in general)

* Normally, if a clue re-touches pink cards that are known to be pink, it is treated as a *Pink Choice Tempo Clue* or a *Pink Choice Finesse*.
* However, what if the indicated slot is not a pink card? That does not make sense, as *Pink Choice* is typically only used to communicate a play about a pink card.
* In this situation, it must not be a *Play Clue* at all. Instead, it is a *Fix Clue* - the rank of the left-most pink card must match the clue.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 3's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob has a known pink card on slot 4 and a known pink card on slot 5.
  * Alice clues number 3 to Bob, which re-touches the pink cards on slots 4 and 5.
  * Normally, Bob would interpret this as a *Pink Choice Tempo Clue* and play his slot 3 card. However, his slot 3 card is completely unclued.
  * Bob instead knows that this must be a *Pink Fix Clue* and that his left-most pink card (on slot 4) must be exactly the pink 3.
  * Bob discards his slot 4 card as pink 3.

### The Bubblegum Prompt & The Bubblegum Finesse

* Normally, when players give a clue to a pink card with a number, they exactly match the number of the card in order to satisfy *Pink Promise*.
* Some common situations where players violate *Pink Promise* are covered in the two different *Pink Play Clue Lie* sections above.
* Rarely, it is also possible to lie about the rank of a pink card that is not yet playable. Doing so communicates the slot number of where the connecting card is.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks
  * Donald has a pink 3 in his hand clued with pink. He does not know the rank of the card.
  * Alice clues Donald number 4, which only touches the pink 3.
  * Bob knows that since the pink 3 is the focus of the clue, it must be playable right now. However, if this was a normal *Finesse* (and Bob had a pink 2 on his *Finesse Position*), then Alice would have used a pink clue or a number 3 clue (to match the real rank of the card, satisfying *Pink Promise*).
  * Bob knows that since Alice did not do either of these things, she must be trying to communicate something extra. This must be a *Bubblegum Finesse*, indicating which slot the pink 2 is in.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the pink 2 in slot 4. Thus, he knows that the *Bubblegum Finesse* is not on him. Bob discards.
  * Cathy goes through the same steps as Bob. Cathy does not see the pink 2 anywhere else, so she knows that the *Bubblegum Finesse* is on her. Cathy blind-plays pink 2 from slot 4.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy played his slot 4 card, this was a *Bubblegum Finesse*, and that his pink card must be the matching card. Donald plays the pink 3.
* Rarely, it is also possible to perform a *[Clandestine Bubblegum Finesse](examples/Clandestine_Bubblegum_Finesse.md)*

### Trash Pushes in Pink

* When a *Trash Push* happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
* When a *Trash Push* happens with a rank clue in a variant with a pink suit, if more than one card is touched, it is possible that only the card on chop was trash and that the other cards touched are useful / critical pink cards.
* In this situation, after blind-playing the *Trash Pushed* card, the player should first discard the card that initiated the *Trash Push* (the oldest card) and then hold on to the other touched cards.

### Pink & Omni Majority Conventions

* This convention only applies to variants that have 50% or more of cards touched by all ranks.
  * For example, in the "Pink & Omni (3 Suit)" variant, 66% of the cards are touched by all ranks, so this convention would apply.
* Just like in normal games, if a rank clue is given to a chop card and it could be a *Save Clue* (e.g. a *2 Save*, *5 Save*, critical pink 3 save, etc.), then it is treated as a *Save Clue*.
* Any **other** type of rank clue is instead treated as a *Positional Clue* clue, telling the person who is clued to play the respective slot number.
