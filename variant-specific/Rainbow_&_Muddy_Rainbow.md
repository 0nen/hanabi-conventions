# Specific Conventions for Rainbow & Muddy Rainbow

These conventions apply to variants with both a rainbow and a muddy rainbow suit.

<br />

### Muddy Rainbow Assumption

* If players get a *Tempo Clue* on two or more cards that could be either rainbow cards or muddy rainbow cards, this puts them in a conundrum:
  * If they are rainbow cards, then they should play the left-most touched card as a normal *Tempo Clue*.
  * If they are muddy rainbow cards, then they should play the right-most touched card as an *Inverted Tempo Clue* (because *Brown Inversion* applies to muddy rainbow cards).
* In this situation, players always assume that they are muddy rainbow cards, and play the right-most card.
