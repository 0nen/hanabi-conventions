# Specific Conventions for Brown

These conventions apply to any variant with a brown (touched by no ranks) suit.

<br />

### Brown Tempo Clues

* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a brown card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get brown cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.

### Brown Inversion

* In a normal *Double Tempo Clue*, all of the re-clued cards are supposed to play from left to right.
* However, when multiple brown cards are re-clued with a brown color clue, it only means to play the right-most one and nothing else.

### Brown Loaded Play Clues

* *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" for brown cards.
* Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that *Loaded Play Clues* **always** apply to brown cards, even in the *Early Game*.

### Brown Positional Clues

* In some situations, a player may have multiple brown cards in their hand, with one of them being playable. If the playable brown card is not the oldest card, it can be difficult to "get" it to play.
* In cases where a number clue is given that has no other conventional interpretation, it is an indication to the player with two or more brown cards of which slot to play.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played.
  * Bob has four brown cards clued with a brown color clue on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  * Alice clues Bob number 2, touching a blue 2 on his slot 1.
  * Bob knows that since all of the 2's are already played, whatever 2 this is must be a trash 2.
  * Bob also knows that this cannot be a *Trash Chop Move*, a *Trash Push*, or any of the other trash moves.
  * Bob instead interprets this as a *Brown Positional Clue*, and plays his slot 2 brown card.
