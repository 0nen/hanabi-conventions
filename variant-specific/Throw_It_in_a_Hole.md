# Specific Conventions for Throw It in a Hole

These conventions apply to the "Throw It in a Hole" variants.

<br />

### No Bluffs

* *Bluffs* are turned off.
* It is okay to perform a *Trash Finesse* for the final card of a particular rank or suit, but *Trash Bluffs* are turned off.

### Priority Changes

* Since 5's do not give a clue back, then they do not have *Priority* over other cards in the same way that they normally do.
