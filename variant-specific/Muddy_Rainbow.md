# Specific Conventions for Muddy Rainbow & Cocoa Rainbow

These conventions apply to any variant with a muddy rainbow suit or a cocoa rainbow suit.

<br />

### Muddy Rainbow Inversion

* Muddy rainbow cards are like brown cards. This means that *Brown Inversion* also applies to muddy rainbow cards.
* This means that when multiple muddy rainbow cards are re-clued with **any** color clue, it only means to play the right-most one and nothing else.

### Muddy Rainbow Saves

* Since muddy rainbow 2 cannot be *2 Saved* and and muddy rainbow 5 cannot be *5 Saved*, there needs to be a separate way to save these cards.
* Any red color clue (the left-most color) to a chop card is treated as a potential *Muddy Rainbow Save* on a muddy rainbow 2 or a muddy rainbow 5.

### Positional Clues

* Any clue that looks like one of the following is instead considered to be a *Muddy Positional Clue* (that promises the slot number of the muddy rainbow card to play):
  * *Double Play Ejection* (re-cluing a playable card)
  * *Known Trash Ejection* (re-cluing a known trash card)
  * *Trash Pushes* (cluing a known trash card on chop for the first time)
  * a rank clue that has no conventional interpretation
* Note that *Trash Chop Moves* are still "turned on".
