# Specific Conventions for Muddy Rainbow & Cocoa Rainbow

These conventions apply to any variant with a muddy rainbow suit or a cocoa rainbow suit.

<br />

### Positional Clues

* Any clue that looks like one of the following is instead considered to be a *Muddy Positional Clue* (that promises the slot number of the muddy rainbow card to play):
  * *Double Play Ejection* (re-cluing a playable card)
  * *Known Trash Ejection* (re-cluing a known trash card)
  * *Trash Pushes* (cluing a known trash card on chop for the first time)
  * a rank clue that has no conventional interpretation
* Note that *Trash Chop Moves* are still "turned on".
