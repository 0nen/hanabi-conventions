# 2-Player Conventions for the Hyphen-ated Framework

<br />

## Introduction

* As stated in the main document, our group generally only plays games with 3 to 5 players, since 2-player games can be quite boring. Thus, the *Hyphen-ated Conventions Framework* is **not optimized for play with only 2-players**.
* With that said, it is possible to use the Hyphen-ated convention framework to also play 2-player games. While not commonly done, it is still perfectly functional, and it is almost always possible to get a perfect scores with expert players.
* This document provides some extra conventions that are used by our group while playing 2-player games.

## Basic Conventions

### No Priority

* *Priority Prompts*, *Priority Finesses*, and so forth are all "turned off".

### One-Away Saves

* In non-2-player games, *Save Clues* must be given to cards that are on chop.
* In 2-player games, *Save Clues* can **also** be given to cards that are 1-away from chop. This gives players the ability to save 2 critical cards in a row.

### No 5's Chop Move

* The *5's Chop Move* convention is "turned off". Any 5 that is clued one-away from chop will just look like a normal *One-Away Save*.

### First Turn Stalls

* On the very first turn of the game, if a known-unplayable card is clued, then it should be treated as a *Save Clue* (instead of a *Self-Finesse*).
  * Players are allowed to use this ability even if there are other playable cards in the hand.

### Second Turn Stalls

* If a *Save Clue* was given to a chop card on the first turn of the game, then the next player is not allowed to discard. They must instead give a give a stall clue. (Otherwise, they are allowed to discard.)
* In a *Second Turn Stalling* situation, if a known-unplayable card is clued, then it should be treated as a *Save Clue* (instead of a *Self-Finesse*), similar to a *First Turn Stall*.

### The Flush Clue (A Slot 1 Color Clue)

* In non-2-player games, it is permissible to use a color clue to save a slot 1 card. In this situation, the player who received the clue would then have a *Locked Hand*.
* However, this is not legal in a 2-player game. Players must use a number clue if they want to give a *Save Clue* to a slot 1 card.
* Thus, color clues that are focused on slot 1 are always *Play Clues*. This is referred to as a *Flush Clue* in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary *Play Clue*.
* Note that you are also allowed to give a *Flush Clue* with black.

## Advanced Conventions

### Scream Discard Modification

* In non-2-player games, *Scream Discards* are only to be used as a last-resort. For example, you are **not** allowed to *Scream Discard* to *Chop Move* a non-critical one-away 3. This is because there is always a risk of discarding a critical card by accident.
* However, this logic does not apply to 2-player games. In a 2-player game, the other player will typically always keep your chop save.
* Thus, in 2-player games, you can *Scream Discard Chop Move* a non-critical but-still-useful card if you want.

### Double Discard Save Stalls

* Just in like 3 to 5-player games, in a 2-player game, players always perform *Hard Double Discard Avoidance*.
* In a player gives a clue in *Double Discard* situation and then they immediately receive a clue that "matches" the discarded card, then they know that this could be a *Save Clue* that was unexpected. Since it was unexpected, they might **also** have another critical card after it.
* Thus, in this situation, the player should give (another) stall clue.
* For example, in a 2-player game:
  * Alice discards a red 3.
  * Bob has nothing to do, so he *Hard Burns* by cluing number 5 to Alice. (This re-clues some 5's, accomplishing nothing.)
  * Alice clues red to Bob, which touches a red card on Bob's chop.
  * Bob interprets this as a potential *Save Clue* on red 3.
  * Bob also knows that the red 3 is newly critical and that Alice was not expecting to have given this clue.
  * Bob *Hard Burns* again by cluing number 5 to Alice.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Bob, saving a 5 on chop. Good thing that Bob stalled!

### The Double Scream Blind-Play

* Sometimes, a player will have 0 clues, but needs to save the chop of the next player. Normally, they would resort to the *Scream Discard Chop Move*. If they have no playable cards in their hand, they can instead use the *Scream Blind-Play* to accomplish the same thing.
* However, if a *Scream Blind-Play* is used when a normal *Scream Discard Chop Move* would have worked, then the player must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, the next player should *Chop Move* twice.

### The Skipped Discard Chop Move

* If the team is at two strikes, players are not able to use the *Scream Blind-Play* (or *Double Scream Blind-Play) because then they would probably strike out and lose the game.
* In this situation, players can resort to the *Skipped Discard Chop Move* instead. Instead of discarding their chop, they discard a card one-away from chop. This would normally indicate that they are *Chop Moved*. However, if no *Chop Move* has occurred, the other player will be able to tell that an emergency is occurring.
* If one card is skipped over, the other player should *Chop Move* one time. If two cards are skipped over, then the other player should *Double Chop Move*. And so forth.
* Players are only allowed to use the *Skipped Discard Chop Move* if the team is at two strikes because using it risks losing the game by discarding some critical card.

### The Scream Push (Anxiety with a Chop Move)

* If a player performs a *Scream Discard Chop Move* when the team is at 0 clues, it will generate a clue for the next player. Normally, the next player is supposed to *Chop Move*, and then give a *Stall Clue*. (They must give a *Stall Clue* just in case they have 2 critical cards in a row. If they do, the next player will *Scream Discard Chop Move* again.)
* However, the above situation does not make sense if the first *Scream Discard* **locks** the next player. This is because if the next player gives a *Stall Clue*, then the team would be back to 0 clues again, and there would never be any way for the player who performed the *Scream Discard* to ever clue anything else.
* This situation should be treated the same as *Anxiety* - even though there is 1 clue available, the locked player **has** to play something to keep the game going.
* If nothing else in their hand makes sense to play, then the locked player should blind-play the *Chop Moved* card.

## Variant-Specific Conventions

### The Flush Save

* Normally, black 3 and black 4 are saved with a black color clue. However, if try to save a black 3 or black 4 like this when it is in a player's slot 1, then will interpret it as a *Flush Clue* and will misplay it.
* Thus, when players are in this situation, they must save using number. Any number 3 or number 4 clue given to a slot 1 card must be treated as a potential save on a black 3 or a black 4, respectively.
