## Announcement Backlog

As noted in the [convention changes document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.
