## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog

**Trash Push Ejection** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is on chop, it communicates a *Trash Push*.
* However, what if the *Trash Pushed* card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Ejection* on the very next player.
```

**Loaded Play Clues** (rename)

```
* *BGA Play Clues* are now renamed to *Loaded Play Clues*, since new players do not know what BGA is.
```

**Unnecessary Chop Move / Trash Double Bluff** (change) (by NoMercy)

```
* The *Unnecessary Trash Chop Move* now takes priority over the *Trash Double Bluff*.
```

**5's Color Ejection (5CE)** (change)

```
* The "*Reverse Finesse*" exception is deleted. Now, when a brand new 5 is touched and you need to determine whether or not it is a 5CE, all you have to do is count the number of blind-plays that you would have to play out of your own hand.
```

**Null Conventions** (change)

```
* Any variant with a null suit is now treated as a *Hard Variant*, meaning that *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" and so forth.
```

**Brown Positional Clues**

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a brown suit.
* In some situations, a player may have multiple brown cards in their hand. If the next brown card to play is not the oldest card, it can be difficult to "get" it to play.
* In cases where a number clue is given that has no other conventional interpretation, it is an indication to the player with two or more brown cards of which slot to play.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played.
  * Bob has four brown cards clued with a brown color clue on slots 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  * Alice clues Bob number 2, touching a blue 2 on his slot 1.
  * Bob knows that since all of the 2's are already played, whatever 2 this is must be a trash 2.
  * Bob also knows that this cannot be a *Trash Chop Move*, a *Trash Push*, or any of the other trash moves.
  * Bob instead interprets this as a *Brown Positional Clue*, and plays his slot 2 brown card.
```

**Occupied Focus Inversion** (by Romain)

```
* Normally, when a player is *Occupied* and they give a clue to someone else, it signifies one of the following three situations:
  1) They are giving a *Chop Focus* clue to the next person as an urgent *Play Clue* or *Save Clue* before it gets discarded.
  2) They are giving a clue that would normally look like a *Save Clue* with the intent to transform it into a *Play Clue* (as an *Occupied Play Clue*).
  3) They are giving a clue that would normally look like a 1-for-1 *Play Clue* with the intent to transform it into a 2-for-1 *Self-Finesse* (as an *Occupied Self-Finesse*).
* If none of the above situations apply and an *Occupied* player gives a *Play Clue* that touches two or more brand new cards, then they must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they are trying to communicate that the focus of the clue should be inverted. The *Play Clue* is either on the left-most card (if it would normally be *Chop Focus*) or on the right-most card (if it would normally be the left-most card).
* *Occupied Focus Inversion* takes precedence over an *Out-of-Order Finesse*. (This follows from *Occam's Razor*; if it could just be a normal *Focus Inversion* play clue, then it does not necessarily promise any blind-plays.)
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Cathy, touching a red 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob clues blue to Alice as a *Play Clue* on a blue 1.
  * Instead of playing her red 1, Cathy clues red to Donald, touching a red 3 on slot 2 and a red 2 on slot 3. This must be a *Play Clue*, since these cards are not on Donald's chop.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy is not playing her red 1 and giving a clue, she must have a good reason.
  * Donald looks around the table and does not see the red 2 in anybody else's *Finesse Position*. Thus, this cannot be a *Selfish Finesse*.
  * Donald also knows that this cannot be a *Self Finesse* or *Self Bluff*. (*Self Bluffs* with color are explicitly illegal.)
  * This must be an *Occupied Focus Inversion*, so Donald marks his right-most card as red 2 for later. The other red card in his hand can be red 3, red 4, or red 5. Donald discards.
```

**Rank Choice Ejection** (with a number 2 or a number 5) (by Jeff)

```
* Typically, when a number 2 clue or a number 5 clue is performed on a chop card, it will be treated as a *2 Save* or a *5 Save* and the card will not play.
* If a player performs a *2 Save* or a *5 Save* on a playable card and they could have easily used a normal color *Play Clue*, this is quite strange. They must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they intend for an *Ejection* on the very next player.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Cathy's hand is completely unclued and is as follows, from left to right: red 2, blue 4, blue 4, blue 3, blue 3
  * Alice clues number 2 to Cathy, touching the red 2 as a *2 Save*.
  * Bob sees that the obvious clue to give to Cathy was red, as it would actually get the red 2 played right now.
  * This move is so bad that it must be communicating something extra. Alice must be intending for a *Rank Choice Ejection*. Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card and it is a blue 1 and successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that since a number 2 clue cause Bob to blind-play his *Second Finesse Position*, this must be an *Ejection*. The only type of *Ejection* that matches this kind of clue is a *Rank Choice Ejection*, so Cathy knows that her 2 must be playable and that her 2 must be exactly the red 2. Cathy plays the red 2.
```

**Very Ambiguous (3 Suits) Conventions**

```
* This convention only applies to Very Ambiguous (3 Suits).
* A blue color clue means to play the *Second Finesse Position* (as before the blue color clue was given).
* Blue color clues are only to be used as a last resort, meaning that if it is possibly to cleanly clue the Second Finesse Position with a number clue, then players must do so.
* Cards touched with blue do not count as being touched for the purposes of discarding, *Good Touch Principle*, and so forth.
```

**The Unnecessary Blue Bluff** (by Jake)

```
* This convention only applies to Very Ambiguous (3 Suits).
* Since blue color clues are only to be used as a last resort, players can use them in situations that are unnecessary in order to communicate something extra.
* In a situation where a clean number clue was available and a blue color clue was used instead, the next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*.
* The next player after that will assume that a *Finesse* occurred. However, once they play their *Second Finesse Position* card and see that it is an unrelated suit, then they will know that an *Unnecessary Blue Bluff* occurred.
```

**The Selfish Finesse (A Finesse Through Your Own Hand)**

```
* Normally, players with playable cards play their cards and let other people give the *Play Clues*. However, sometimes players with a playable card can perform a *Finesse* through their own hand.
* This is often necessary to "lock in" the *Finesse* before the cards move out of *Finesse Position*. Like any other *Finesse*, players in this situation should just mark the cards for later and wait patiently for the cluer to play their card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues red to Bob, touching a red 1 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*. (This is now a globally-known red 1, since Cathy does not have any red 1's in her hand.)
  * Bob clues red to Cathy, touching a red 3 on slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Cathy sees that Alice has as red 2 on her *Finesse Position*, so this must be a *Selfish Finesse*. Bob did not want to play the red 1 because then the *Finesse* might go away and he wanted to lock it in. Cathy marks her red card as potentially red 3 and discards.
  * Alice sees that Bob gave a *Play Clue* to a red 3. Bob knows for sure that he has the red 1, so Alice must have the red 2 on her *Finesse Position*. Alice marks her *Finesse Position* card as red 2 and discards.
  * Bob plays red 1.
  * Cathy discards.
  * Alice blind-plays red 2.
```

**Positional Slides** (for null)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* By convention, *Positional Clues* must target null cards. Thus, if a *Positional Clue* targets a card that already has a clue on it, then it slides over and targets the slot one position to the right.
  * If the *Positional Clue* targets the right-most card, then it slides over to the left.
* This allows players the flexibility to "get" a null card when the clue types that would directly target the null card are not available.
```

**5 Pull Ejection** (deleted)

```
* *5 Pull Ejection is deleted* in favor of *5 Number Discharge*.
```

**5 Number Discharge** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* In the *Early Game*, if a number 5 clue is performed on a 5 that is not already on chop, then it is a *Play Clue* on the 5 (if there are any 5's that are directly playable).
* If there are no directly playable 5's, then the clue is instead a *5 Stall*.
* If a *5 Stall* is not allowed, then it is a *5's Chop Move* (if the card is one-away-from-chop) or a *5 Pull* (if the card is two or more away from chop).
* If a *5 Pull* is performed on a card that is one-away-from-playable, it typically communicates a *5 Pull Finesse*.
* However, if the *5 Pulled* card is two or more away from playable **or** the *5 Pulled* card is trash, then the clue must instead be a *Play Clue* on the 5 as a *Finesse*.
* If the very next player sees that they will only have to **blind-play one card** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse* and blind-play their *Finesse Position*.
* If the very next player sees that they would have to **blind-play two or more cards** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Discharge* and that the next player should play their *Third Finesse Position*.
  * *Prompts* don't factor into the "two or more blind-plays" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 on slot 1.
  * Cathy hand is as follows: red 5, red 2, red 3, green 1, green 2
  * Bob sees that Alice's clue cannot be a *5 Stall* or a *5 Pull*. If it were a *Finesse* on the red 5, he would have to blind-play a red 1 and a red 4.
  * Since Bob would have to blind-play two cards into the *Finesse*, he knows that he should instead treat this as a *5 Number Discharge*. Bob blind-plays his slot 3 card and it successfully plays as the red 1.
```

**The Purge Bluff (Layered Bluff)**

```
* This convention only applies to 3-player games.
* Sometimes, a player will have a fully playable hand from left to right. In this situation, players will normally try to perform a *Layered Finesse* in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a *Layered Finesse* may not always be available.
* In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a lie in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are *Layered Finessed* when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the matching card, they will know that they were *Purge Bluffed* and that nobody has the missing card.
* Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not *Purge Bluffed*) will understand what is going on. For example, they might think that a *Patch Finesse* is happening. Thus, *Purge Bluffs* can only be done in expert games where there is **no other possible interpretation for what is happening**.
```

**Brown Loaded Play Clues** (clarification)

```
* *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" for brown cards.
* Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that *Loaded Play Clues* **always** apply to brown cards, even in the *Early Game*.
```

**Relaxed 2 Saves** (in null variants)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* It is optional for players to give *Save Clues* to null 2's.
* Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any *Elimination Notes* for them.
```

**5 Ejection** (in Duck) (by Kakashi)

```
* *5 Color Ejection* is turned on in Duck variants, as you would expect.
* Additionally, players can also perform *5 Number Ejection* and it will generally work in the exact same way.
* Thus, players should keep in mind that clues that cause *Ejection* might have been either a color clue or a number clue.
```

**4 Charm** (in Duck) (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to Duck variants.
* *Charm* is defined as a move that makes a player play their *Fourth Finesse Position*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, if a player gives a *Play Clue* to an unplayable 4 that would require two or more blind-plays in order to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely.
* Players agree that this communicates a *Charm*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, *4 Charm* can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.
```

**Cow & Pig Rank Saves**

```
* This convention only applies to *Cow & Pig* variants.
* Rank clues (oink) are always used to perform a *Save Clue*.
* Color clues (moo) must always be *Play Clues*.
```

**Trash Pushes in Pink**

```
* When a *Trash Push* happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
* When a *Trash Push* happens with a rank clue in a variant with a pink suit, if more than one card is touched, it is possible that only the card on chop was trash and that the other cards touched are useful / critical pink cards.
* In this situation, after blind-playing the *Trash Pushed* card, the player should first discard the card that initiated the *Trash Push* (the oldest card) and then hold on to the other touched cards.
```

**1's Color Ejection (1CE)**

```
* Similar to *5 Color Ejection*, it is also possible to perform a *1 Color Ejection* in an *Up or Down* variant.
* 1CE works in the exact same way as 5CE does (e.g. players use the "2 or more blind-plays" rule).
```

**Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *Discharge* on the very next player (similar to a *Bluff*).
* However, if a *Unknown Trash Discharge* is performed, and the very next player does not have a *Third Finesse Position*, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that the clued card is trash.
* In this situation, the *Discharge* is on the next player with a *Third Finesse Position*:
  * The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue.
  * After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's has two 5's in his hand in slots 3 and 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a *5 Save* earlier on in the game.)
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 1 on his slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that Donald will think that this red card is red 2. But if a card blind-plays from *Finesse Position*, then Donald will think that the card is red 3. Thus, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  * Bob does not have a *Third Finesse Position*. (He only has two unclued cards in his hand.)
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge* on Cathy.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as red 2.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her *Third Finesse Position* card, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge* and that his red card is red 1. Donald discards the red 1.
```

**Pink & Omni Majority Conventions** (by Fireheart)

```
* This convention only applies to any variant that has 50% or more cards touched by all ranks.
  * For example, in Pink & Omni (3 Suit), 66% of the cards are touched by all ranks, so this convention would apply.
* Just like in normal games, if a rank clue is given to a chop card and it could be a *Save Clue* (e.g. a *2 Save*, *5 Save*, critical pink 3 save, etc.), then it is treated as a *Save Clue*.
* Any **other** type of rank clue is instead treated as a *Positional Clue* clue, telling the person who is clued to play the respective slot number.
```

**Null Saves** (change) (by Razvogor)

```
* It is considered illegal to perform any kind of *Chop Move* on a non-critical null 3 or a non-critical null 4.
  * This rule counts for both *Positional Saves* and normal *Chop Moves* (such as the *5's Chop Move*).
* Thus, when a player is *Chop Moved* early on for a null card, they can know for sure that it is either a null 2 or a null 5.
```

**Muddy/Cocoa Positional Clues** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a Muddy Rainbow suit or a Cocoa Rainbow suit.
* Any clue that looks like one of the following is instead considered to be a *Muddy/Cocoa Positional Clue* (that promises the slot number of the Muddy/Cocoa card to play):
  * *Double Play Ejection* (re-cluing a playable card)
  * *Known Trash Ejection* (re-cluing a known trash card)
  * *Trash Pushes* (cluing a known trash card on chop for the first time)
  * a rank clue that has no conventional interpretation
* Note that *Trash Chop Moves* are still "turned on".
```

**The Gentleman's Discard Ejection** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, if a player performs a *Gentleman's Discard* and the other card is **not** on *Finesse Position*, it could be several things:
  1) If the card on *Finesse Position* is itself playable right now, then it would be a *Layered Gentleman's Discard*.
  2) If the card on *Finesse Position* is exactly one-away-from-playable, then it would be a *Patch Gentleman's Discard* (and call for the next-player to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card).
  3) If the card on *Finesse Position* is two or more away from playable, or a trash card, then it is usually an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.
* If the third option is true and it is **not** an emergency situation and the player is **not** making a mistake, then the player who is performing the weird *Gentleman's Discard* is instead intending for the next player to *Eject* as a *Gentleman Discard Ejection*. Doing so will demonstrate that the card is not on the *Finesse Position* and is instead on the *Second Finesse Position*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a known red 2 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the red 2, but it is not in her *Finesse Position*. Cathy has a red 1 (trash) on *Finesse Position*, followed by a red 2.
  * Bob knows that it would be pointless for Alice to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* and then for Bob to waste a clue giving a *Fix Clue*. So, if Alice is not making a mistake, she must be trying to communicate something deeper.
  * Bob knows that if Alice wanted him to play his *Finesse Position* card, this would not work, as Cathy would interpret the situation as a *Patch Gentleman's Discard* and would go on to misplay the red 1.
  * Bob knows that this situation signals a *Gentleman's Discard Ejection*, so he blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card and it a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that some kind of *Ejection* is going on, since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position*. Since the previous action was a *Gentleman's Discard*, this must be a *Gentleman's Discard Ejection*, which means that Cathy's red 3 is on her *Second Finesse Position* instead of her *First Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy blind-plays the red 2.
```

**Reverse Finesse Restriction** (by Florrat)

```
* This convention only applies in a Cow & Pig variant.
* It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)
```

**Pink Tempo Clues**

```
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a pink card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get pink cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Brown Tempo Clues**

```
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a brown card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get brown cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```
