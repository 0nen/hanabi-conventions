## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog

**Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *Discharge* on the very next player (similar to a *Bluff*).
* However, if a *Unknown Trash Discharge* is performed, and the very next player does not have a *Third Finesse Position*, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that the clued card is trash.
* In this situation, the *Discharge* is on the next player with a *Third Finesse Position*:
  * The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue.
  * After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's has two 5's in his hand in slots 3 and 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a *5 Save* earlier on in the game.)
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 1 on his slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that Donald will think that this red card is red 2. But if a card blind-plays from *Finesse Position*, then Donald will think that the card is red 3. Thus, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  * Bob does not have a *Third Finesse Position*. (He only has two unclued cards in his hand.)
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge* on Cathy.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as red 2.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her *Third Finesse Position* card, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge* and that his red card is red 1. Donald discards the red 1.
```

**The Gentleman's Discard Ejection** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, if a player performs a *Gentleman's Discard* and the other card is **not** on *Finesse Position*, it could be several things:
  1) If the card on *Finesse Position* is itself playable right now, then it would be a *Layered Gentleman's Discard*.
  2) If the card on *Finesse Position* is exactly one-away-from-playable, then it would be a *Patch Gentleman's Discard* (and call for the next-player to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card).
  3) If the card on *Finesse Position* is two or more away from playable, or a trash card, then it is usually an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.
* If the third option is true and it is **not** an emergency situation and the player is **not** making a mistake, then the player who is performing the weird *Gentleman's Discard* is instead intending for the next player to *Eject* as a *Gentleman Discard Ejection*. Doing so will demonstrate that the card is not on the *Finesse Position* and is instead on the *Second Finesse Position*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a known red 2 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the red 2, but it is not in her *Finesse Position*. Cathy has a red 1 (trash) on *Finesse Position*, followed by a red 2.
  * Bob knows that it would be pointless for Alice to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* and then for Bob to waste a clue giving a *Fix Clue*. So, if Alice is not making a mistake, she must be trying to communicate something deeper.
  * Bob knows that if Alice wanted him to play his *Finesse Position* card, this would not work, as Cathy would interpret the situation as a *Patch Gentleman's Discard* and would go on to misplay the red 1.
  * Bob knows that this situation signals a *Gentleman's Discard Ejection*, so he blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card and it a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that some kind of *Ejection* is going on, since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position*. Since the previous action was a *Gentleman's Discard*, this must be a *Gentleman's Discard Ejection*, which means that Cathy's red 3 is on her *Second Finesse Position* instead of her *First Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy blind-plays the red 2.
```

**Reverse Finesse Restriction** (by Florrat)

```
* This convention only applies in a Cow & Pig variant.
* It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)
```

**Pink Tempo Clues**

```
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a pink card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played. (This is the same convention as with brown cards.)
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get pink cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Brown Tempo Clues**

```
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a brown card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get brown cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Pseudo Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Dark Omni or Gray Pink suit .
* Dark Omni or Gray Pink cards on chop should be saved with number 5 clue. *Pink Promise* does not apply in this variant.
```

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Pseudo-Rank Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Dark Omni or Gray Pink suit.
* In situations where there are critical cards behind Dark Omni or Gray Pink cards, you are also allowed to *Fake Save* the cards with any number (either 2, 3, or 4). (Again, *Pink Promise* does not apply to this variant.)
```

**The Bad Touch Layered Finesse (Bluffs that Blind-Play a Duplicated Card)**

```
* If a player performs a *Bluff* that causes a blind-play of a globally-known duplicated card, that is quite strange. Doing this is not very good, as it violates *Good Touch Principle* and does not accomplish very much in general.
* Players agree that this is not a *Bluff* at all, but instead a *Layered Finesse*. The player who blind-played the card should continue to blind-play cards until they find the promised card.
* This section also applies to *Priority Bluffs* that cause the blind-play of a duplicated card.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a globally-known red 3 in her hand. (It is "filled in" with both a red clue and a number 3 clue.)
  * Alice clues blue to Bob, touching a blue 4 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that this must be a *Finesse*, so he attempts to blind-play blue 3 from his *Finesse Position*. Instead, he blind-plays red 3.
  * Cathy discards her chop.
  * Alice discards her known red 3 (since it is already played and is now trash).
  * Bob knows that *Bluffs* that duplicate a card like this are supposed to be treated as *Layered Finesses*. Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* as blue 3 and it successfully plays.
