## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog

**The Hyphen-ated Convention Framework**

The group has **changed** the way that our convention framework is handled to be more organized and transparent. **Everyone should read this short Q&A** to learn how things will happen going forward: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md

This document also explains how these announcements work and how exactly group consensus is reached for any particular decision.

**2-Player Conventions**

There is now a separate document for 2-player games, located here: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md
It describes the way that players in our group have historically played 2-player games. It also has some new strategies added recently that everyone may not be familiar with. Going forward, any changes to 2-player strategies will be announced. (Historically, 2-player strategy changes have not been deemed important enough to announce.)
