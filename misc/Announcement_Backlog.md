## Announcement Backlog

As noted in the [convention changes document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

**The Double 5 Pull** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* Normally, in the *Early Game*, it is impossible to perform a *5 Pull* on a chop card, because it will instead be interpreted as an an *Early 5's Chop Move*. In this situation, players will almost always just give a direct *Chop-Focus Play Clue* (and then give a *5 Save* to the 5 later on).
* However, what if a player performs an *Early 5's Chop Move* on a playable card instead of just giving a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*? They must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they are really trying to perform a *Double 5 Pull*, which pulls a card from the next player and also pulls a card from the player who received the number 5 clue. The next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, which gives the clue receiver enough information to know that the move was really a *5 Pull* after all.
```
```
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 3.
  * Cathy's slot 4 card is a red 1. (This was her chop card prior to the number 5 clue being given.)
  * It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that Donald has a red 2 on his slot 2 that could be *Play Clued* with a red color clue.
  * Normally, since it is the *Early Game*, a number 5's clue to Cathy might just be a *5 Stall*. However, since Alice could have given the red *Play Clue* to Donald, this is an "early" 5's clue, so it must be an *Early 5's Chop Move*.  However, this cannot be an *Early 5's Chop Move* either, since Cathy has a playable red 1 on her chop.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is a *Double 5 Pull*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Double 5 Pull*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).

**The 5 Pull Ejection and The 5 Pull Ejection Chop Move** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, if someone performs a *5 Pull* on a card that is one-away-from-playable, it promising that someone has the in-between card as a *5 Pull Finesse*.
* However, if someone performs a *5 Pull* on a card that is two-away (or more) from playable card, then they must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they intend the next player to blind-play their *Second Finesse Position* card as a *5 Pull Ejection*.
* The player receiving the clue should also *Chop Move* the *5 Pull* target, as it is likely to be a useful card that the team will need later.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 1. Cathy has a blue 4 on slot 2. There are other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, so this looks like a *5 Pull* on the blue 4.
  * Bob knows that if no-one on the team does anything, Cathy will go on to misplay the blue 4 as a *5 Pull*.
  * Bob also knows that if he plays his *Finesse Position* card, Cathy will still go on to misplay the blue 4 as a *5 Pull Finesse*.
  * Thus, Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy know knows that the card to the right of her 5 is two (or more) away from being playable. She also marks the card as being chop moved.
* Rarely, it is possible for a *5 Pull Ejection* to occur where the player who receives the number 5 clue is able to determine that the only "other" thing to clue must be a card in their hand. In this situation, they might be hesitant to discard. By convention, players are allowed to discard in this situation. (This follows from *Guide Principle*.)
