## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

<br />

## The Backlog

@everyone Convention clarifications:

**Blind-Playing Chop Moved Cards** (clarification)

```
* Often times, cards are *Chop Moved* towards the beginning of the game. Normally, once the time comes, the *Chop Moved* card will be clued directly in order to get it to play.
* However, other times, the *Chop Moved* card will sit there and will never be clued.  As the game progresses towards the end, the player with the *Chop Moved* card will learn more and more information about it. For example, they might accumulate a lot of negative clues on the card. Or, they might deduce that it is probably not any of the cards that are already played (which drastically reduces the possibilities towards the end of the game).
* A clever player who accumulates enough information about a *Chop Moved* card may determine that all of the possibilities for the card are playable. In this situation, they do not have to wait for their teammates to clue the card directly - they can simply blind-play the *Chop Moved* card and it will work, regardless of which exact card it is.
* Blind-playing cards in this manner can be risky! It is fairly common for players to forgo cluing *Chop Moved* cards directly in favor of using the other copy of the card in someone else's hand. (For example, it may be more efficient to use the non-*Chop Moved* copy if it would be a 2-for-1 clue instead of a 1-for-1 clue.) Thus, there is always the chance that blind-playing a *Chop Moved* card in this manner will get a strike for the team (in the case where the other copy was used or in the case where the *Chop Move* was a mistake).
```
```
* For this reason, clever players should try to blind-play their *Chop Moved* cards if they have a pretty good chance of being playable, but only if the team has one or more strikes to spare.
* Subsequently, players should **not** clue a now-useless *Chop Moved* card to prevent a future strike. The typical strategy is to just let it be *Chop Moved* for the rest of the game:
  * In the best case scenario, the *Chop Moved* player will naturally figure out that the card is trash and can safely discard it. Or, alternatively, they will keep the card *Chop Moved*, but continue to discard other useless cards from their chop until the end of the game.
  * In the worst case scenario, the *Chop Moved* player will try to blind-play the card and get a strike for the team. But this is not guaranteed, and even if they do, they will only do it if there is a strike to spare.
```

@everyone New conventions:

**Very Ambiguous (3 Suits) Conventions**

```
* This convention only applies to Very Ambiguous (3 Suits).
* A blue color clue means to play the *Second Finesse Position* (as before the blue color clue was given).
* Blue color clues are only to be used as a last resort, meaning that if it is possibly to cleanly clue the Second Finesse Position with a number clue, then players must do so.
* Cards touched with blue do not count as being touched for the purposes of discarding, *Good Touch Principle*, and so forth.
```

**The Unnecessary Blue Bluff** (by Jake)

```
* This convention only applies to Very Ambiguous (3 Suits).
* Since blue color clues are only to be used as a last resort, players can use them in situations that are unnecessary in order to communicate something extra.
* In a situation where a clean number clue was available and a blue color clue was used instead, the next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card as a *Known Bluff*.
* The next player after that will assume that a *Finesse* occurred. However, once they play their *Second Finesse Position* card and see that it is an unrelated suit, then they will know that an *Unnecessary Blue Bluff* occurred.
```

**Positional Slides** (for null)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* By convention, *Positional Clues* must target null cards. Thus, if a *Positional Clue* targets a card that already has a clue on it, then it slides over and targets the slot one position to the right.
  * If the *Positional Clue* targets the right-most card, then it slides over to the left.
* This allows players the flexibility to "get" a null card when the clue types that would directly target the null card are not available.
```

**5 Pull Ejection** (deleted)

```
* *5 Pull Ejection is deleted* in favor of *5 Number Discharge*.
```

**5 Number Discharge** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* In the *Early Game*, if a number 5 clue is performed on a 5 that is not already on chop, then it is a *Play Clue* on the 5 (if there are any 5's that are directly playable).
* If there are no directly playable 5's, then the clue is instead a *5 Stall*.
* If a *5 Stall* is not allowed, then it is a *5's Chop Move* (if the card is one-away-from-chop) or a *5 Pull* (if the card is two or more away from chop).
* If a *5 Pull* is performed on a card that is one-away-from-playable, it typically communicates a *5 Pull Finesse*.
* However, if the *5 Pulled* card is two or more away from playable **or** the *5 Pulled* card is trash, then the clue must instead be a *Play Clue* on the 5 as a *Finesse*.
* If the very next player sees that they will only have to **blind-play one card** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse* and blind-play their *Finesse Position*.
* If the very next player sees that they would have to **blind-play two or more cards** in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Discharge* and that the next player should play their *Third Finesse Position*.
  * *Prompts* don't factor into the "two or more blind-plays" rule. Players only count the number of blind-plays.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a 5 on slot 1.
  * Cathy hand is as follows: red 5, red 2, red 3, green 1, green 2
  * Bob sees that Alice's clue cannot be a *5 Stall* or a *5 Pull*. If it were a *Finesse* on the red 5, he would have to blind-play a red 1 and a red 4.
  * Since Bob would have to blind-play two cards into the *Finesse*, he knows that he should instead treat this as a *5 Number Discharge*. Bob blind-plays his slot 3 card and it successfully plays as the red 1.
```

**The Purge Bluff (Layered Bluff)**

```
* This convention only applies to 3-player games.
* Sometimes, a player will have a fully playable hand from left to right. In this situation, players will normally try to perform a *Layered Finesse* in order to get all of the cards in the most efficient manner. However, a *Layered Finesse* may not always be available.
* In extremely rare situations, it is possible to orchestrate a lie in which the player with the fully playable hand thinks that they are *Layered Finessed* when they really do not have the connecting card. After they play their final card and it is not the matching card, they will know that they were *Purge Bluffed* and that nobody has the missing card.
* Care has to be taken that the other player (e.g. the player who is not *Purge Bluffed*) will understand what is going on. For example, they might think that a *Patch Finesse* is happening. Thus, *Purge Bluffs* can only be done in expert games where there is **no other possible interpretation for what is happening**.
```

**Brown Loaded Play Clues** (clarification)

```
* *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned on" for brown cards.
* Normally, *Loaded Play Clues* are "turned off" in the *Early Game*. However, note that *Loaded Play Clues* **always** apply to brown cards, even in the *Early Game*.
```

**Relaxed 2 Saves** (in null variants)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a null suit.
* It is optional for players to give *Save Clues* to null 2's.
* Thus, if a null 2 is discarded, players should not make any *Elimination Notes* for them.
```

**5 Ejection** (in Duck) (by Kakashi)

```
* *5 Color Ejection* is turned on in Duck variants, as you would expect.
* Additionally, players can also perform *5 Number Ejection* and it will generally work in the exact same way.
* Thus, players should keep in mind that clues that cause *Ejection* might have been either a color clue or a number clue.
```

**4 Charm** (in Duck) (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to Duck variants.
* *Charm* is defined as a move that makes a player play their *Fourth Finesse Position*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, if a player gives a *Play Clue* to an unplayable 4 that would require two or more blind-plays in order to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely.
* Players agree that this communicates a *Charm*.
* Similar to *5 Ejection*, *4 Charm* can be initiated with either a color clue or a number clue.
```

**Cow & Pig Rank Saves**

```
* This convention only applies to *Cow & Pig* variants.
* Rank clues (oink) are always used to perform a *Save Clue*.
* Color clues (moo) must always be *Play Clues*.
```

**Trash Pushes in Pink**

```
* When a *Trash Push* happens in a normal variant, if more than one card is touched, then all of the touched cards are known to be trash.
* When a *Trash Push* happens with a rank clue in a variant with a pink suit, if more than one card is touched, it is possible that only the card on chop was trash and that the other cards touched are useful / critical pink cards.
* In this situation, after blind-playing the *Trash Pushed* card, the player should first discard the card that initiated the *Trash Push* (the oldest card) and then hold on to the other touched cards.
```

**1's Color Ejection (1CE)**

```
* Similar to *5 Color Ejection*, it is also possible to perform a *1 Color Ejection* in an *Up or Down* variant.
* 1CE works in the exact same way as 5CE does (e.g. players use the "2 or more blind-plays" rule).
```

**Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *Discharge* on the very next player (similar to a *Bluff*).
* However, if a *Unknown Trash Discharge* is performed, and the very next player does not have a *Third Finesse Position*, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that the clued card is trash.
* In this situation, the *Discharge* is on the next player with a *Third Finesse Position*:
  * The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue.
  * After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's has two 5's in his hand in slots 3 and 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a *5 Save* earlier on in the game.)
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 1 on his slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that Donald will think that this red card is red 2. But if a card blind-plays from *Finesse Position*, then Donald will think that the card is red 3. Thus, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  * Bob does not have a *Third Finesse Position*. (He only has two unclued cards in his hand.)
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge* on Cathy.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as red 2.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her *Third Finesse Position* card, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge* and that his red card is red 1. Donald discards the red 1.
```

**Pink & Omni Majority Conventions** (by Fireheart)

```
* This convention only applies to any variant that has 50% or more cards touched by all ranks.
  * For example, in Pink & Omni (3 Suit), 66% of the cards are touched by all ranks, so this convention would apply.
* Just like in normal games, if a rank clue is given to a chop card and it could be a *Save Clue* (e.g. a *2 Save*, *5 Save*, critical pink 3 save, etc.), then it is treated as a *Save Clue*.
* Any **other** type of rank clue is instead treated as a *Positional Clue* clue, telling the person who is clued to play the respective slot number.
```

**Null Saves** (change) (by Razvogor)

```
* It is considered illegal to perform any kind of *Chop Move* on a non-critical null 3 or a non-critical null 4.
  * This rule counts for both *Positional Saves* and normal *Chop Moves* (such as the *5's Chop Move*).
* Thus, when a player is *Chop Moved* early on for a null card, they can know for sure that it is either a null 2 or a null 5.
```

**Muddy/Cocoa Positional Clues** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a Muddy Rainbow suit or a Cocoa Rainbow suit.
* Any clue that looks like one of the following is instead considered to be a *Muddy/Cocoa Positional Clue* (that promises the slot number of the Muddy/Cocoa card to play):
  * *Double Play Ejection* (re-cluing a playable card)
  * *Known Trash Ejection* (re-cluing a known trash card)
  * *Trash Pushes* (cluing a known trash card on chop for the first time)
  * a rank clue that has no conventional interpretation
* Note that *Trash Chop Moves* are still "turned on".
```

**The Gentleman's Discard Ejection** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, if a player performs a *Gentleman's Discard* and the other card is **not** on *Finesse Position*, it could be several things:
  1) If the card on *Finesse Position* is itself playable right now, then it would be a *Layered Gentleman's Discard*.
  2) If the card on *Finesse Position* is exactly one-away-from-playable, then it would be a *Patch Gentleman's Discard* (and call for the next-player to blind-play their *Finesse Position* card).
  3) If the card on *Finesse Position* is two or more away from playable, or a trash card, then it is usually an emergency situation or a player is making a mistake.
* If the third option is true and it is **not** an emergency situation and the player is **not** making a mistake, then the player who is performing the weird *Gentleman's Discard* is instead intending for the next player to *Eject* as a *Gentleman Discard Ejection*. Doing so will demonstrate that the card is not on the *Finesse Position* and is instead on the *Second Finesse Position*.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice discards a known red 2 as a *Gentleman's Discard*.
  * Bob sees that Cathy has the red 2, but it is not in her *Finesse Position*. Cathy has a red 1 (trash) on *Finesse Position*, followed by a red 2.
  * Bob knows that it would be pointless for Alice to perform a *Gentleman's Discard* and then for Bob to waste a clue giving a *Fix Clue*. So, if Alice is not making a mistake, she must be trying to communicate something deeper.
  * Bob knows that if Alice wanted him to play his *Finesse Position* card, this would not work, as Cathy would interpret the situation as a *Patch Gentleman's Discard* and would go on to misplay the red 1.
  * Bob knows that this situation signals a *Gentleman's Discard Ejection*, so he blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card and it a blue 2 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that some kind of *Ejection* is going on, since Bob blind-played his *Second Finesse Position*. Since the previous action was a *Gentleman's Discard*, this must be a *Gentleman's Discard Ejection*, which means that Cathy's red 3 is on her *Second Finesse Position* instead of her *First Finesse Position*.
  * Cathy blind-plays the red 2.
```

**Reverse Finesse Restriction** (by Florrat)

```
* This convention only applies in a Cow & Pig variant.
* It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)
```

**Pink Tempo Clues**

```
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a pink card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get pink cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Brown Tempo Clues**

```
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a brown card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get brown cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Chiaroscuro Pseudo Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Chiaroscuro Pink suit.
* Chiaroscuro Pink cards on chop should be saved with number 5 clue. *Pink Promise* does not apply in this variant.
```

**Chiaroscuro Pseudo-Rank Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Chiaroscuro Pink suit.
* In situations where there are critical cards behind Chiaroscuro Pink cards, you are also allowed to *Fake Save* the Chiaroscuro Pink cards with any number (either 2, 3, or 4). (Again, *Pink Promise* does not apply to this variant.)
```
