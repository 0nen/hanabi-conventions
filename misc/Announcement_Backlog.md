## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

## The Backlog

**Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, players are only allowed to perform a *Discharge* on the very next player (similar to a *Bluff*).
* However, if a *Unknown Trash Discharge* is performed, and the very next player does not have a *Third Finesse Position*, then they cannot demonstrate to the team that the clued card is trash.
* In this situation, the *Discharge* is on the next player with a *Third Finesse Position*:
  * The player being passed over knows that the next player will blind-play, so they can either discard or give an unrelated clue.
  * After that, the next player should blind-play their card immediately to demonstrate what is going on.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * All of the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Bob's has two 5's in his hand in slots 3 and 4. (They were clued with number 5 as a *5 Save* earlier on in the game.)
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 1 on his slot 1 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob knows that Donald will think that this red card is red 2. But if a card blind-plays from *Finesse Position*, then Donald will think that the card is red 3. Thus, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge*.
  * Bob does not have a *Third Finesse Position*. (He only has two unclued cards in his hand.)
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is an *Out-of-Position Unknown Trash Discharge* on Cathy.
  * Bob discards.
  * Cathy blind-plays her *Third Finesse Position* and it successfully plays as red 2.
  * Donald knows that since Cathy blind-played her *Third Finesse Position* card, this must be an *Unknown Trash Discharge* and that his red card is red 1. Donald discards the red 1.
```

@everyone Variant-specific conventions:

**Pink Tempo Clues**

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a pink suit.
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a pink card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played. (This is the same convention as with brown cards.)
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get pink cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Brown Tempo Clues**

```
* This convention only applies to variants with a brown suit.
* If a player gives a *Tempo Clue* to a brown card, it is never a *Tempo Clue Chop Move*, even if it only gets one card played.
* This is because it is fairly valuable to get brown cards out of the hand as soon as possible in case blocking cards are drawn.
```

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Pseudo Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Dark Omni or Gray Pink suit .
* Dark Omni or Gray Pink cards on chop should be saved with number 5 clue. *Pink Promise* does not apply in this variant.
```

**Dark Omni & Gray Pink Pseudo-Rank Saves**

```
* This convention only applies in variants with a Dark Omni or Gray Pink suit.
* In situations where there are critical cards behind Dark Omni or Gray Pink cards, you are also allowed to *Fake Save* the cards with any number (either 2, 3, or 4). (Again, *Pink Promise* does not apply to this variant.)
```

**Reverse Finesse Restriction** (by Florrat)

```
* This convention only applies in a Cow & Pig variant.
* It is illegal to perform a *Reverse Finesse* with a rank clue on the first turn. (This makes things more clear for players when they are given a *Save Clue* and there are some playable cards on *Finesse Position* to get.)
```
