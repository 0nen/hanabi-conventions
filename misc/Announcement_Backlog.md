## Introduction

As noted in the [convention changes document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md), sometimes a change to the conventions is made but is not yet announced due to there being a backlog of things to announce. This document contains the backlog.

The next announcement will be on November 6th.

<br />

## The Backlog

**The Hyphen-ated Convention Framework**

The group has **changed** the way that our convention framework is handled to be more organized and transparent. **Everyone should read this short Q&A** to learn how things will happen going forward: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Changes.md

This document also explains **how these weekly announcements work** and **how exactly group consensus is reached** for any particular decision.

**2-Player Conventions**

There is now a separate document for 2-player games, located here: https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/2-Player.md

It describes the way that players in our group have historically played 2-player games. It also has new strategies that have been added recently. Going forward, any changes to 2-player strategies will be announced. (In the past, 2-player strategy changes have not been deemed important enough to announce.)

**The Useless Bluff** (deleted)

```
* This convention is deleted, since it conflicts with *Junk Ejection*. (*Junk Ejection* is a move that is not announced yet.)
```

**Reverse Order Ejection** (deleted)

```
* This convention is deleted, as it is hardly ever used.
```

**The Suboptimal Color Bluff** (deleted)

```
* This convention is deleted, as it is hardly ever used.

**Priority Potential Duplication & The Certain Priority Finesse** (by Zamiel & Libster)

```
* Normally, players can perform any particular type of *Finesse* either by giving a clue or by playing a card without *Priority*. For example, it is possible to both do a *Layered Finesse* (by giving a clue) and a *Layered Priority Finesse* (by playing a card).
* One exception to this rule is the *Certain Finesse*. When a player perform a *Certain Finesse*, it calls for a *Certain Discard*. However, when a player uses *Priority* to promise a card that could potentially be in their own hand, this should **not** induce a *Certain Discard*. The other players in this situation should just ignore the *Priority* and instead discard their chop card.
```

**The Triple Bluff** (clarification)

```
* In some situations, cluing a 5 with color initiates a special move called a *5 Color Ejection*. And in some situations, cluing a 5 with rank initiates a special move called a *5 Pull* or a *5's Chop Move*. However, if players are in a situation where none of these moves would apply, then it is possible to perform a *Triple Bluff* by giving a *Play Clue* to a 5 (with either color or number).
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks.
  * Emily has a red 5 that has a number 5 clue on it. (It was *5 Saved* in the *Early Game*.)
  * Alice clues red to Emily, "filling in" the red 5 as a *Play Clue*. (This cannot be a *5 Color Ejection*, because that move requires the 5 to be freshly touched.)
  * Bob sees that no-one else has the red 2. Bob blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card as red 2, but it is instead a blue 2.
  * Cathy knows a blue 2 does not match a red 5, so this must be some kind of *Bluff*. However, a red 5 is not a valid *Bluff* target and it is also not a valid *Double Bluff* target. Thus, this must be a *Triple Bluff*. Cathy blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card as any playable card, and it plays as green 2.
  * Donald also knows that this must be a *Triple Bluff* for the same reasons that Cathy does. Donald blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it plays as a yellow 2.
```

**The 5's Triple Bluff** (by Zamiel)

```
* The example in the previous section was a "normal" *Triple Bluff* because the red 5 was three-away-from-playable. However, players also explicitly agree that a *Triple Bluff* target can be **any** 5, even if it is not exactly three-away-from-playable. (This is the extension of the *3 Bluff* convention and the *4's Double Bluff* convention.)
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * All the 1's are played on the stacks except for red 1.
  * Emily has a red 5 that has a number 5 clue on it. (It was *5 Saved* in the *Early Game*.)
  * Alice clues number 5 to Emily, re-touching the 5 as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob, Cathy, and Donald blind-play their *Finesse Position* cards.
  * Emily knows that when the number 5 clue was given, the red 5 was four-away from playable, and all of the other 5's were three-away from playable. This means that normally, Emily would mark her 5 as any 5 except for red 5. (This is because cards that are three-away-from-playable are normally used to *Triple Bluff*.)
  * However, since the *5's Triple Bluff* convention exists, Emily knows that any 5 can be used to initiate a *Triple Bluff*. Thus, her 5 can be **any** 5 in the game, including red 5.
```

**Trash Double Bluff (Form 1)** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, *Trash Bluffs* are only done as a last resort. When a *Trash Bluff* is performed that is unnecessary, then it is an *Unnecessary Trash Bluff Chop Move*. However, if there are no cards left to *Chop Move*, then this interpretation does not make any sense.
* In this situation, the interpretation should revert to a *Trash Double Bluff*.
```

**Trash Double Bluff (Form 2)** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, *Trash Bluffs* are only done as a last resort, meaning that the target card cannot be clued directly. In this situation, if a player has the option to initiate the *Trash Bluff* with a single card, then they **must** choose to do so.
* If a player deliberately does not initiate the *Trash Bluff* with a single card and instead initiates a *Trash Bluff* by touching two or more trash cards, then they must be trying to communicate something extra - a *Trash Double Bluff*.
  * If a player is doing a *Unnecessary Trash Bluff Chop Move*, then they can clue as many trash cards as they want and it should not trigger a *Trash Double Bluff*.
* All of the cards touched in this way are promised to be trash.
```

**The 5 Double Pull** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* Normally, in the *Early Game*, it is impossible to perform a *5 Pull* on a chop card, because it will instead be interpreted as an an *Early 5's Chop Move*. In this situation, players will almost always just give a direct *Chop-Focus Play Clue* (and then give a *5 Save* to the 5 later on).
* However, what if a player performs an *Early 5's Chop Move* on a playable card instead of just giving a *Chop-Focus Play Clue*? They must be trying to communicate something extra.
* In this situation, they are really trying to perform a *5 Double Pull*, which pulls a card from the next player and also pulls a card from the player who received the number 5 clue. The next player should blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, which gives the clue receiver enough information to know that the move was really a *5 Pull* after all.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 3.
  * Cathy's slot 4 card is a red 1. (This was her chop card prior to the number 5 clue being given.)
  * It is now Bob's turn. Bob sees that Donald has a red 2 on his slot 2 that could be *Play Clued* with a red color clue.
  * Normally, since it is the *Early Game*, a number 5's clue to Cathy might just be a *5 Stall*. However, since Alice could have given the red *Play Clue* to Donald, this is an "early" 5's clue, so it must be an *Early 5's Chop Move*.  However, this cannot be an *Early 5's Chop Move* either, since Cathy has a playable red 1 on her chop.
  * Thus, Bob knows that this is a *5 Double Pull*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that if this was an *Early 5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. Since he blind-played his *Finesse Position* card, this must be a *5 Double Pull*. Cathy blind-plays her slot 4 card (the card to the right of the clued 5).
* More examples of a *5 Double Pull* can be found [here](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/examples/5_Double_Pull.md).
```

**Junk Ejection (with Trash)** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is not on chop, it communicates a *Trash Chop Move*.
* However, what if the *Chop Moved* cards are also all trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Ejection* on the very next player.
* *Junk Ejection* can be performed throughout the game. (But keep in mind that in the *End-Game*, a player might just be stalling.)
```

**Junk Ejection (with 5's)** (by Jeff)

```
* First, see the above section "Junk Ejection (with Trash)".
* Normally, if a player performs a *5's Chop Move* on a trash card, it would signal a *Finesse* on all of the cards leading up to the 5.
* If the very next player sees that **they will only have to blind-play one card in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse***, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse*.
* If the very next player sees that they would have to blind-play two or more cards in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Ejection* and that the next player should play their *Second Finesse Position*.
* After the *Ejection*, the player receiving the 5 clue will knows that they have trash on their chop.
* For example, in a 5-player game:
  * It is the *Mid-Game* and all of the 2's are played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a blue 5 on slot 3.
  * Cathy's slot 4 card is a red 1. (This was her chop prior to the number 5 clue being given.)
  * It is now Bob's turn. Bob knows that since Alice *Chop Moved* a trash card, this would normally signal that the blue 5 is playable right now.
  * However, that would mean that Bob must have both the blue 3 and the blue 4, which is unlikely. Bob knows that *Junk Ejection* takes priority if he is supposed to play two or more blind cards, so he blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position*. It is a green 1 and successfully plays.
  * Cathy knows that if this was an *5's Chop Move*, then Bob would not have blind-played anything. If it was a *Finesse*, then Bob would have blind-played his *Finesse Position*. Since he blind-played his *Second Finesse Position* card, this must be a *Junk Ejection* and her slot 4 card must be trash.
```

**Trash Push Ejection** (by Jeff)

```
* Normally, when known trash is touched as the focus of the clue, and the known trash is on chop, it communicates a *Trash Push*.
* However, what if the *Trash Pushed* card is trash? The other players can see that this clue must have some other purpose - it should signal an *Ejection* on the very next player.
```

**The 5 Pull Ejection and The 5 Pull Ejection Chop Move** (by Jeff)

```
* This convention only applies in the *Early Game*.
* Normally, if someone performs a *5 Pull* on a card that is one-away-from-playable, it promising that someone has the in-between card as a *5 Pull Finesse*.
* Subsequently, if someone performs a *5 Pull* on a card that is two-away (or more) from playable card, then they might be trying to perform a *5 Pull Double Finesse*.
* If the very next player sees that **they will only have to blind-play one card in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse***, then they should assume that it is a *Finesse* and blind-play their *Finesse Position*.
* If the very next player sees that they would have to blind-play two or more cards in their hand to fulfill the *Finesse*, then a *Finesse* is unlikely. Instead, players agree that this signals an *Ejection* and that the next player should play their *Second Finesse Position*.
* The player receiving the clue should also *Chop Move* the *5 Pull* target, as it is likely to be a useful card that the team will need later.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * It is the first turn and nothing is played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues number 5 to Cathy, touching a red 5 on slot 1. Cathy has a blue 4 on slot 2. There are other *Play Clues* for Alice to give, so this looks like a *5 Pull* on the blue 4.
  * Bob knows that if no-one on the team does anything, Cathy will go on to misplay the blue 4 as a *5 Pull*.
  * Bob also knows that if he plays his *Finesse Position* card, Cathy will still go on to misplay the blue 4 as a *5 Pull Finesse*.
  * Thus, Bob blind-plays his *Second Finesse Position* card. It is blue 1 and it successfully plays.
  * Cathy now knows that the card to the right of her 5 is two (or more) away from being playable. She also marks the card as being chop moved.
* Rarely, it is possible for a *5 Pull Ejection* to occur where the player who receives the number 5 clue is able to determine that the only "other" thing to clue must be a card in their hand. In this situation, they might be hesitant to discard. By convention, players are allowed to discard in this situation. (This follows from *Guide Principle*.)
```

**Stacked 5 Color Ejection** (by Fireheart)

```
* Normally, you are not allowed to perform a *Bluff* on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a *Finesse*. (This is because the next player will allow for the possibility of a *Layered Finesse*, and the *Bluff* will not resolve immediately.)
* Similarly, since *Ejections* follow most of the same rules as *Bluffs*, you are not allowed to perform an *Ejection* on a player that is already "loaded" with a blind-play for a *Finesse*.
* So, if a 5 is clued with color in this situation, the next player is to assume a *Stacked Finesse* instead of a *5 Color Ejection*. Thus, they would then play the card from the original *Finesse* (or play nothing if the card from the original *Finesse* is not yet playable).
* However, what if the next player can know that a *Stacked Finesse* is impossible due to them not having enough possible cards to fulfill the *Finesse*? In this case, it would be a *Known Stacked 5 Color Ejection*.
* When this occurs, players should immediately play their *First Finesse Position* (slot 2) instead of their *Second Finesse* position (slot 3).
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Nothing is played on the stacks and it is the first turn of the game.
  * Alice clues red to Donald, touching a red 2. This is a *Finesse* on Cathy's red 1 (in her slot 1).
  * Bob clues blue to Donald, touching a blue 5.
  * Now, it is Cathy's turn. Cathy knows that she has a playable red 1, since no-one else on the team has a red 1.
  * Additionally, Cathy might think that Bob's clue was a *Stacked Finesse* on the blue 5. However, this is impossible, because Cathy sees that no-one else on the team has any blue cards. Thus, for a *Stacked Finesse* to be the case, Cathy would have to have red 1, blue 1, blue 2, blue 3, and blue 4, and Cathy only has 4 cards in her hand (since it is a 4-player game).
  * Since a *Stacked Finesse* is impossible, Cathy knows that this must be a *Stacked 5 Color Ejection*.
  * Alice's clue *Finessed* Cathy. So after Alice's clue, Cathy's *Finesse Position* moved to her slot 2 and her *Second Finesse Position* moved to her slot 3.
  * Normally, *Ejection* calls for the *Second Finesse Position*, but in this case, Cathy knows that *Stacked 5 Color Ejections* call for the *First Finesse Position* instead of the *Second Finesse Position*, so Cathy blind-plays slot 2 (instead of slot 3).
