# Changes to The Hyphen-ated *Convention Framework*

* The set of conventions that everyone in the Hyphen-ated group agrees to is defined as the *Convention Framework*.
* The framework evolves over time, as new strategies are thought up, older strategies are no longer used, and existing strategies are changed.

## How are *Convention Framework* changes proposed?

* Players typically propose new conventions or changes to existing conventions in the `#new-conventions` channel in [the Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp).
* They do this by typing up a short paragraph of the proposed change. Examples and screenshots are also welcome so that other players can easily understand what is being proposed.
* Then, other players can comment on whether they like it or not, or if they see any potential problems.
* The `#new-conventions` channel is a typical chat room. This means that if more than one convention is being discussed simulataneously, it may be hard to sort out what is what.
* Because of the non-threaded nature of the chat room, players should feel free to quote and respond to an earlier convention discussion, even if it does not appear to be the "current" topic of discussion.

## How formal is the process to change the *Convention Framework*?

* It is fairly **informal**.
* Historically, many active players have choosen to largely ignore the `#new-conventions` channel, since it can be noisy.
* There are only a handful of people who bother to read the `#new-conventions` channel and made decisions. So, there is no strong system or set of rules governing *Convention Framework* changes.

## How long are *Convention Framework* changes discussed for?

* No decisions are made immediately, as:
  * We want the convention framework to change fairly slowly.
  * Not every player regularly reads the `#new-conventions` channel, so we want to allow time for everyone to comment.
* The length of time to wait will depend on how big the change is:
  * If it is a small, non-controversal change, then it might be added to the reference document the next day.
  * If it is a brand new move, then we would typically want to wait a week or two so that everyone has time to chime in.
  * If there is a good amount of consensus about a move, then this will shorten the amount of time that it is in consideration for.

## What decides whether or not a change gets implemented?

* All reference document changes are made by **group consensus**.
* For the purposes of determining consensus, each player that has an opinion is given a weighed representation based on the following things (in ordered of most important to least important):
  * Perceived skill level
  * Holistic knowledge of the convention framework
  * How active they are at the current time (playing every day, etc.)
  * How long they have been playing with the group
  * How many games they have played with the group
  * How often they participate in the `#new-conventions` channel
  * How strongly they feel
* Choosing consensus is necessarily arbitrary. In the case of a "tie" or a close call, preference is given to keeping the *Convention Framework* the way that it already is.

## How is consensus determined when a proposed change is not discussed?

* Many convention proposals are ignored or not heavily discussed.
* If it is a large or potentially contentious change, then I gather consensus manually by sending a direct message a few of the elder members of the group, asking what their opinion / vote is.
* If it is a small change and I have no particular opinion on it, then I infer consensus based on what how I understand the current mood to be.
* If it is a small change and I have an opinion on the change, then I usually decide one way or the other as the deciding vote.

## How fast does the *Convention Framework* as a whole change?

* Changes usually happen slowly, over the course of months. This allows players who only play occasionally time to adjust (e.g. players who only play on the weekends, and so forth).

## How permanent are changes to the *Convention Framework*?

* No change is permanent and if the group consensus changes, then the *Convention Framework* should change.
* With that said, it is confusing for players in the group who do not play that often to have a certain move be "turned on" one day and then "turned off" the next day. Thus, we do **not** want the *Convention Framework* to flop back and forth.
* If consensus is reached on a certain convention configuration, then as a general rule it should not be up for debate again for a period of one year.

## Why are conventions deleted? Who decides when a convention should be removed from the reference document?

* After a period of time, rarely-used conventions are removed from the convention framework and deleted from the reference document. The reasons for this are two fold:
  * Every "move" or section in the reference document has a cost associated with it. It is only worth the cost if the move is routinely used. The logic for this is outlined in the [convention goals document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/misc/Convention_Goals.md).
  * The reference document is a living document meant to be a reflection of what players in our group actually do on a day-to-day basis, rather than an encyclopedia of all possible Hanabi moves.
* Whether or not a move is used often enough to warrant being included in the reference document is also based on consensus.
