## Hanabi Group Meta-Progression

Observing the evolution of Hanabi groups is an interesting case-study because:
* it is drastically different from strategy evolution in typical online computer games
* it allows some rough comparison between disparate, independent Hanabi groups

### Online Games

In order to faciliate online play, computer games often have a centralized public server, with players around the world connecting to that server. In this model, many different kinds of users get the chance to comingle with one another. This comingling is not just through gameplay, but also through discussion in chat rooms, watching tournaments, and so forth. Could we make any predictions about the overall strategy used in such an environment? One might first hypothesize that it would be a mess - with so many different players touting different strategies, a common thread would never emerge from the chaos. Interestingly, in the most popular competitive strategy games such as [Starcraft 2](https://starcraft2.com/en-us/) and [League of Legends](https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US), this does not quite end up being the case.

Indeed, in any environment with many independent agents, the strategies used will never fully converge. However, in the same vein that one can walk around the downtown of a city on Friday night for a few hours to get a sense for what is currently "in vogue" with respect to fashion, it is also possible to observe many different games on a centralized server to get a sense for what is currently "in vogue" with respect to strategies. Things do end up converging quite a bit, and in video game jargon this is referred to as the metagame, or "meta" for short - the current set of popular strategies that you can roughly expect your opponents to be using.

Why do players converge on a meta at all? This has a straightforward explanation: in order to maximize their winrate, players are incentivied to copy the strategies of the players that beat them. Or, to cut to the chase, they can just directly copy the strategies of the best players in the world, as shown in televised / streamed games. In other words, we can see that almost every online game is like a shared petri dish - everyone evolves together to roughly converge on the same meta.

### Offline Games

With this in mind, Hanabi is interesting because it is **not a shared petri dish**. Since Hanabi is an offline board game / card game, many independent groups around the world hear about Hanabi at their local board game meetup. And then they start playing Hanabi with their group of friends, start to learn the tendencies of their friends, and start to develop strategy. But a group of players in Germanay will have no idea what kind of strategies a group in England is playing with.

When we observe different "organically grown" Hanabi groups, we find some interesting things. Nearly all groups independently come up with some of the same strategies like *Finesses* and *Bluffs*. But at the same time, groups also develop entirely unique strategies. One important thing to note here is that "poaching" a strategy from another group is oftentimes not effective, because the strategy will only get a lot of value when other seemingly unrelated conventions are "turned on" or when other subtle assumptions are being made.

### Hanabi Group Classification

So offline games are different from online games in that players may not end up converging on the same set of strategies. With that said, we **can** discuss how Hanabi groups have a certain meta-progression that they follow as time passes.

1) The group gets familiar with the rules of the game and sets some basic conventions. Players will quickly figure out that a number 5 clue is supposed to mean "save this card for later". They will figure out how to achieve predictable discards with the concept of the "chop" card.

2) The group realizes that Hanabi is mostly about efficiency - you want to get as many cards played as you can with the least amount of clues. So this is the step when strategies like the *Finesse* and *Bluff* are invented. The rate of perfect scores drastically increases.

3) The group starts to get pretty good at Hanabi. A new meta begins where players discard aggressively to ensure the maximum amount of *Finesses* can occur. More advanced conventions are agreed upon. This can either be explicit, if done in a pre-game briefing, or implicit, if a player unconsciously taps into their reservoir of historical knowledge to determine how their teammate will react to a particular situation.

4) The group reaches the first stage of Hanabi mastery - they get a perfect score in the vast majority of their games. Indeed, they are so efficient that games are often finished with a ridiculous amount of clues in the bank. However, they find that when they do not get a perfect score, it is usually because they discarded some non-important 3 or 4 in the beginning or middle of the game, and then they got "bottom-decked" by that card in the end of the game.

5) The group realizes that in order to continue to increase winrate and avoiding plateauing, the "efficiency" dial must be turned down. If there is enough efficiency to win every game anyway, configuring things to be more efficient ends up being useless. It actually becomes more important to "trade in" efficiency for things like orchestrating safe discards and making sure that "bottom-deck" losses can be mitigated as much as possible.
