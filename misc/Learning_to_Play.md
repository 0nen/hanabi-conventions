# Learning to Play Hanabi

This is a short blog on some loosely-related topics having to do with learning to play Hanabi.

## Plateaus

Hanabi may be unlike anything you've learned before.

In learning some things, progress is linear. Let's take the example of training for a footrace. In your first week of doing mile-long runs, your times might be around 9 minutes. But in the second week, you might find that your average time drops to around 8 minutes. And in the third week, the average time might go down to 7 minutes. This is great - as a runner looking to improve, you have a clear, quantitative indication of your progress. And it is motivating to know that you are for-sure improving.

In learning other things, progress is not quite so straightforward. Hanabi is interesting in that almost all players **do not** learn in the way outlined in the previous example. Typically, players will *plateau* at a certain skill level, making the **exact same mistake** over and over. And then, after a period of no observable increase in skill, they will make a breakthrough - the thing that they consistently messed up over and over is now effortless.

For example, one of the first things that people usually *plateau* on is the ability to "see" *Finesses* - new players will **always** miss *Finesses* directed at them. In the grand scheme of things, this isn't a big deal, because it can be a good learning experience. But even after an in-depth *Finesse* explanation is given in the post-game review, the new player will go on to miss another *Finesse* in the next game. Why aren't they learning from their mistake? Because they have *plateaued*.

In this scenario, it's obviously going to be frustrating for the *Finesse*-missing player. They are going to feel dumb that they keep making the same mistake. They are going to feel like they are not making any progress. And when playing games, they will have to devote much of their mental energy to try and figure out if every single clue given is a *Finesse* or not.

But after a week or so of this, the new skills will have had time to settle, and something will "click" in their brain. All of a sudden, the player will realize that seeing *Finesses* is trivial - they are automatically playing into them without thinking about it at all. We could say that the player has had a break-through and is no longer *plateaued*.

Of course, there is much more to Hanabi than just seeing *Finesses*. After their breakthrough, the player will find that they consistently make some new mistake, like failing to see an *Order Chop Move*. And now, all of their mental energy previously devoted to seeing *Finesses* is now devoted to seeing *Order Chop Moves*. And so the cycle repeats.

Why is it important to talk about the *Plateau Effect*? Well, as a newer player, it is important to realize that Hanabi is pretty hard. Not only will you make mistakes, but you will make **the same mistakes** over and over. And you will *plateau*. But this is relatively normal, so there's **no reason to feel discouraged**. All of the expert players have made all of the same mistakes you have, and hundreds of other ones, besides. So they know that it would be unrealistic for someone to be able to learn the game in a day. (Or a week for that matter... or even a month!) Just like Chess, Hanabi is complicated and takes a long time to master.

## The Convention Build-Up

As you probably know, in the Hyphen-ated group, we play with a lot of conventions - things that we agree to before the game starts. Unlike other groups, we write all of these down in a formal document. And this document is *long*.

### The History

A common reaction to seeing a hundred-page-long conventions document for the first time is often surprise: "Holy shit, these guys are crazy Hanabi nerds!" But the surprise can quickly turn to disgust: "That's insane, how can they remember all of these conventions? I would never want to play like this. Even if I did, learning all of these conventions would take years."

And indeed, looking at it from the outside-in, I can agree and sympathize with this reaction. But I think it is important to understand the story of how we got here in the first place.

Our group started playing Hanabi like all other groups - with no conventions whatsoever. Eventually, after getting a little comfortable with the game, we figured out basic things like "*Play Clues* should probably mean to play the left-most card". Eventually, we graduated to playing *Board Game Arena*-style: a few simple conventions with some *Finesses* and *Bluffs* thrown in.

Lots of people who play Hanabi are also general board game enthusiasts, enjoying a wide variety of board games (like *Codenames* and *Food Chain Magnate*) and card games (like *Dominion*). So it is common for groups to play Hanabi for a month or so - getting comfortable with the game, developing some conventions, getting pretty good at the game, and then moving on to new challenges. But we loved Hanabi and didn't stop playing. Not every day, and not always with the exact same players, but certainly a few games at week at minimum.

As the months went by, we played more and more games. Sometimes, we would stumble upon a unique situation that was difficult to solve with just the "vanilla" set of base conventions. This led to the creation of a new convention - some new kind of *Chop Move*, or some new kind of *Finesse*. And since it was only a couple moves added or changed every month or so, it was relatively easy for everyone to keep up. Even if you didn't play regularly, you could read the #announcements channel in the Discord and quickly get up-to-date on the latest changes over the last month or two. And brand new players could get up-to-speed relatively quickly.

But as the years went by, you can imagine what happened. The process of adding a new move here and there over the course of 3 years can result in *a lot* of moves. The punchline of this story is that our huge convention list is not an artificial list of things invented all at once. Rather, it is a list of things that naturally flowed from playing 5000+ games of Hanabi in a process of slow iteration, week by week, month by month.

### Learning the Conventions from Scratch

So even if you can understand and empathize with the history of the long convention document, there is still a problem with getting new players up-to-speed. We certainly want new players to join our group - if we stopped getting new players entirely, the group would eventually die out. But with each convention we add, it gets just a little bit harder to come in starting from scratch. There's no getting around it - playing Hanabi with our group is going to be more complicated and more difficult than playing Hanabi with others, because we have been already playing for many years.

But there are some important counterpoints:

1) Advanced conventions are "turned off" when playing with beginners

Beginners don't have to worry about learning everything all at once, because we will "turn off" all of the advanced stuff so that the beginner can focus on the fundamentals.

2) Players **do not** need to know most of the information in the reference document.

**Most** of the moves in the reference document follow from basic logic. New players can usually figure out what a move is in the middle of the game without ever having seen it before! (But it is still worth putting the move in the reference document, just to be thorough.)

Some other things in the reference document only apply **very rarely**, like once in every hundred games or so. So it would be fairly pointless to burden non-expert players with it, as it would be knowledge that would almost never be utilized. (But it is still worth putting the situation in the reference document, just to be thorough.)

Yet other things in the reference document only apply to specific variants. There are over 50 different variants on Hanabi Live, and unless you are an expert player, it is going to be pretty pointless to try and learn the intricacies of each one, especially considering that people typically play "No Variant" and "Rainbow" games for their first 100-200 games.

3) We want to strike a compromise between new and expert players.

From time to time, we "pare down" the convention-framework to try and reduce to total amount (and complexity) of the conventions. We never want to get to a point where it becomes too complicated to learn the framework from scratch.

But we also want to keep the expert players from getting bored. As a group, we want to continue to innovate and refine our convention-framework to be the best it can be, and sometimes that can mean changing some existing convention or adding a brand-new move.

4) Higher-level and more fulfilling games

What is the flip-side of having more conventions and more complexity? First off, it raises the skill ceiling. Hanabi throws plenty of tricky situations at you, and you only have a limited amount of tools to solve them. By adding some conventions, it can be like adding additional tools to the toolbelt. For expert players, by empowering them with more tools, it increases the total ways in which they can solve problems, making the game take on a new layer of beauty. But even for newer players, it can be very fun to learn how to make your teammates blind-play cards from their hands in new and exciting ways.

We know that for people who really like Hanabi, it will be worth the extra effort to play with a little more complexity.
