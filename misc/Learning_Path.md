# Learning Path for New Players in The Hyphen-ated Group

### Introduction

In the Hyphen-ated group, we get new players from time to time. Some only play with us for a few days, and some continue to play for years! But no matter how long people play for, there is always more to learn, because Hanabi has a ton of depth, similar to chess.

For those who love Hanabi and wish to continue playing with the group, the path from a brand-new player to a player with 1+ years of experience is a long one. It will be filled with many practice games, countless mistakes, and the learning of many different conventions.

When playing with brand-new players, everyone in the group knows to **keep it simple**, and only use the basic strategies that are covered in the [../Beginner.md](beginner guide). But usually after someone plays 5-10 beginner games, things start to "oepn up" a bit, and they start learning about "extra" stuff, like *Bluffs* and *Chop Moves*. There's a lot to learn, and we don't want to overwhelm new players with it all at once. So what's the correct order to learn stuff in?

Handily, the main [reference document](../Reference.md) is sorted into different "levels" that group conventions based on skill-level. Before a game starts, newer players **should make it clear what level they are**. And then everyone in the group **should stick to using only conventions in that level**. For advanced players, it may be tempting to show a newer-players an advanced kind of *Finesse* or *Ejection*. But don't do it! Keep it simple! Let them learn the fundamentals before introducing more complicated things.

Why is this kind of thing important? A common mistake we see from intermediate players is that once they learn about an advanced move, they think that they understand how it works, and then they whip it out in a situation that is completely out of place. As the expression goes, you have to "learn to walk before you learn to run". Intermediate players who know advanced moves but have poor planning and a poor general understanding of the game **are much harder to work with** than intermediate players who stick to the basics, make predictable moves, and incorporate things slowly.

### Level Descriptions

Just to make it perfectly clear, here is a brief description of each level, explaining what should and should not be used.

<br />

#### Level 1 - Beginner

* Level 1 strategies can be learned with no games of Hanabi played. You can either learn them before you play your first game or after you play a few games to learn the basic mechanics.
* These strategies are covered in the [../Beginner.md](beginner guide).
* The list is as follows:
  * *Play Clues*
  * *Save Clues*
  * *Principle 1 - Good Touch Principle*
  * *Principle 2 - Save Principle*
  * *Principle 3 - Minimum Clue Value Principle*
  * *The 5 Stall*
  * *The Prompt*
  * *The Finesse*
* There are **no** *Bluffs* and **no** *Layered Finesses* at this level.

#### Level 2 - Novice

* Level 2 strategies should only be learned if you have played with the group a few times and have got the basics down. (5-10 games of experience or more.)
* These strategies are covered in the [../Reference](main reference document).
* This level contains the moves that compose our "core" repertoire. While these moves may not be used in every single game, the complexity level of all of them is fairly low.
* 

#### Level 3


#### Level 4


#### Level 5
