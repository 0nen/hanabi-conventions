## Examples of the Pestilent Double Bluff

### Example 1

* It is Dr_Kakashi's turn.
* Imagine that Dr_Kakashi clues number 3 to Kyle. That would touch the blue 3 as a *Play Clue*.
* The next player is Sucubis. He knows that this is a *Finesse*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card (slot 1) as a blue 2. Instead, it is a black 2 and it successfully plays. Sucubis now knows that he was *Bluffed*.
* The next player is Valetta6789. She knows that something weird has just happened. Since black 2 matches a number 3 clue, Kyle will think that he has the black 3 (and it will go on to misplay).
* Valetta6789 knows that Dr_Kakashi would never intentionally perform such a bad clue - he must be trying to communicate something extra. Valetta6789 knows that this is a *Disease Bluff* situation - the blue 3 is now *Diseased*.
* Valetta6789 knows that normally, it would now be her responsibility to perform a *Heal Clue* in order to *Heal* the diseased card. But in this case, that doesn't make any sense - there is only one copy of the black 3, and if Kyle saw the black 3, then he would already know that he does not have the black 3 and nothing would need to be healed.
* Subsequently, since a *Heal Clue* is not possible, Valetta6789 knows that this must be a *Pestilent Double Bluff*. She blind-plays her *Finesse Position* card (slot 1). It is purple 1 and it successfully plays.
* The next player is Kyle. After the number 3 clue was given and the black 2 blind-played, Kyle thought that his 3 was the black 3 (since 2 matches 3). However, if it was black 3, then Valetta6789 never would have blind-played. Thus, Kyle knows that his 3 must be some other 3 than black 3, so he marks it as such.

### Example 2

* It is scharkbite's turn.
* Imagine that scharkbite clues number 3 to asaelr. This would touch the black 3 as a *Play Clue*.
* The next player is iamwhoiamhahaha. He knows that this a *Finesse*, so he blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card (slot 3) as black 2. Instead, it is red 2 and it successfully plays. iamwhoiamhahaha now knows that he was *Bluffed*.
* The next player is Romain672. He knows that something weird has just happened. Since red 2 matches a number 3 clue, asaelr will think that he has the red 3 (and it will go on to misplay).
* However, in this case Romain672 knows that asaelr will **not** think he has the red 3, because scharkbite has both of them in his own hand.
* With that said, scharkbite does not know that he has both of the red 3's in his hand; from scharkbite's perspective, asaelr **will** go on to think that he has red 3.
* Romain672 knows that scharkbite would never intentionally perform such a bad clue - he must be trying to communicate something extra. Romain672 knows that this is a *Disease Bluff* situation - the black 3 is now *Diseased*.
* Since it is impossible for Romain672 to give a *Heal Clue*, Romain672 knows that this must be a *Pestilent Double Bluff*. He blind-plays his *Finesse Position* card (slot 1). It is purple 2 and it successfully plays.
* The next player is asaelr. After the number 3 clue was given and the red 2 blind-played, asaelr thought that his 3 was the red 3 (since 2 matches 3). However, if it was red 3, then Romain672 never would have blind-played. Thus, asaelr knows that his 3 must be some other 3 than red 3, so he marks it as such.
