## Examples of the Disease Bluff

### Example 1

* It is the first turn of the game and Dr_Kakashi starts.
* Imagine that Dr_Kakashi clues number 2 to RaKXeR. That would touch the green 2 as a *Play Clue*.
* The next player is MasN. From MasN's perspective, this looks like a *Finesse*. MasN knows that he probably has the green 1 on his *Finesse Position*. MasN blind-plays his *Finesse Position* and it is yellow 1 and successfully plays. MasN now knows that he was *Bluffed*.
* The next player is Kyle. Kyle sees that from RaKXeR's perspective, a *Finesse* just occurred, and the 2 in RaKXeR's hand is the yellow 2 (to match the yellow 1 that was blind-played). This is a problem (because the card really is green 2 and RaKXeR will go on to misplay it).
* Kyle knows that Dr_Kakashi must be trying to communicate something extra. When this kind of thing happens, it is usually a *Good Touch Bluff*, which means that someone else already has the yellow 2 clued in their hand. However, this is not the case because Dr_Kakashi gave the clue on the first turn of the game and obviously no-one has any clued cards in their hand yet.
* If it isn't a *Good Touch Bluff*, then Kyle knows that it could be a *Disease Bluff*. Kyle sees that MasN has a yellow 2 in his hand. In *Disease Bluff* situations, Kyle knows that he is supposed to give a *Heal Clue*, so Kyle clues yellow to MasN, which only touches the yellow 2. (The *Heal Clue* is also a *Play Clue*.)
* From RaKXeR's perspective, Dr_Kakashi's move looked like a *Finesse* after MasN blind-played the yellow 1. However, immediately afterward, Kyle clued the yellow 2 in MasN hand. If RaKXeR really did have the yellow 2, then this clue would be violating *Good Touch Principle* and would be pointless. RaKXeR knows that his 2 must be something other than yellow 2 and that Dr_Kakashi performed a *Disease Bluff*.
