* It is joelwool's turn and he clue's red to Kakashi filling in the R2.
* Normally, the Y3 can be either finessed or bluffed out, but there are no targets.
* The next thing to do would be to clue the Y3 directly with 3 or yellow, which gives no additional information to Kakashi's hand.
* By filling in the R2, Kakashi will now know the exact identity of one of the cards in his hand, while also getting the Y3 to be played.
* Kakashi plays Y3, which resolves immediately as a Self Color Bluff and no other cards are promised.
