## Examples of the 5 Double Pull

### Example 1

* Dr_Kakashi clues number 5 to invarse. That touches the blue 5. Since the blue 5 is one-away from chop, invarse will think that this is the *5's Chop Move*.
* The next player is micerang. He knows that performing a *5's Chop Move* on a playable red 2 is nonsensical, since if Dr_Kakashi had instead just clued red, then invarse would play the red 2 immediately.
* Micerang knows that since this is the *Early Game* and a playable card was *5's Chop Moved*, this must be a *5 Double Pull*. Micerang plays his *Finesse Position* card (slot 1). It is a yellow 1 and it successfully plays.
* The next player is invarse. Invarse knows that since a *5's Chop Move* got micerang to blind-play his *Finesse Position*, this must be a *5 Double Pull*. Invarse blind-plays the *Chop Moved* card (slot 2). It is a red 2 and it successfully plays.
