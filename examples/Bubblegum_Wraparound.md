## Examples of the [Bubblegum Wraparound](../variant-specific/Pink.md#the-bubblegum-wraparound)

#### Example 1

![bubblegum_wraparound](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/bubblegum_wraparound.png)

- (This screenshot depicts the variant of "Black & Light Pink (6 Suits)", but for the purposes of this explanation, we can just assume that the pink cards are normal.)
- It is the first turn of the game and Zakisan starts.
- Zakisan wants to do a *Bubblegum Finesse* on TheDaniMan's pink 1 in slot 2 and will.i.am's pink 2 in slot 2.
- If Zakisan clues pink to will.i.am, or he clues number 2 to will.i.am, then it will just looks like a normal *Finesse*, and jack67889 will misplay his green 3 as a pink 1.
- Instead, Zakisan gives a 5 clue to will.i.am, touching the pink 2 in slot 2.
- From will.i.am's perspective, it is an *Early 5's Chop Move* since there is something else for Zakisan to do. He marks his slot 2 card as a 5 and *Chop Moves* his slot 3 card.
- The next player is jack67889. jack67889 sees that this is a *Bubblegum Wraparound Finesse* on TheDaniMan, so he does something unrelated.
- The next player is TheDaniMan. From TheDaniMan's perspective, Zakisan's number 5 clue breaks *Pink Promise*. If Zakisan is not making a mistake, then he must be trying to communicate something special - a *Bubblegum Finesse*.
- TheDaniMan does not see a pink 1 in anyone else's hand, so he knows that the *Bubblegum Finesse* is on him.
- Normally, a *Bubblegum Finesse* that is initiated with a number 5 clue would call for someone's slot 5 card. However, since it is a 6-player game, each player only has 3 slots. So TheDaniMani has no slot 5 card to respond to the *Bubblegum Finesse*.
- However, TheDaniMan also knows that in this situation, the *Bubblegum Wraparound* convention applies. A number 4 clue would wrap around to his slot 1, and a number 5 clue would wrap around to his slot 2. Thus, TheDaniMan blind-plays his slot 2 card as a *Bubblegum Wraparound Finesse*. It is a pink 1 and it successfully plays.
- The next player is will.i.am. will.i.am is surprised by the pink 1 blind-play, but he realizes that it must be a *Bubblegum Wraparound Finesse*. will.i.am undoes the *Chop Move* on his slot 3 card and plays the pink 2 from slot 2.

#### Example 2

![bubblegum_wraparound2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/bubblegum_wraparound2.png)

- This screenshot shows the same situation as example 1.
- In other words, rz can clue number 5 to Carunty in order to get wump to blind-play slot 2 (as a *Bubblegum Wraparound Finesse*).

#### Example 3

![bubblegum_wraparound3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/master/img/examples/bubblegum_wraparound3.png)

- It is jack67889's turn.
- Sucubis has a globally known pink 1 on slot 2 (which was given a *Play Clue* earlier on).
- jack67889 gives a number 5 clue to Sucubis, touching both pink cards on slot 2 and 3.
- The next player is Sucubis. For now, Sucubis just plays his pink 1 from slot 2.
- The next player is XMIL. XMIL analyzes jack67889's clue:
  - Since Sucubis already knew about the pink 1, the number 5 clue was focused on Sucubis' slot 3 card.
  - A number 5 clue violates *Pink Promise* on the pink 3.
  - Thus, this must be a *Bubblegum Finesse* on XMIL's slot 5.
  - However, XMIL's slot 5 card is a card that is "filled-in" to be a known rainbow card.
  - Since XMIL's slot 5 card is not a pink card, this must be a *Bubblegum Wraparound Finesse*, so number 5 should wrap around to his slot 1.
- XMIL blind-plays his slot 1 as a *Bubblegum Wraparound Finesse*. It is a pink 1 and it successfully plays.
