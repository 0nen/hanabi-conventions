# 2-Player Conventions for the Hyphen-ated Framework

<br />

### Introduction

* As stated in the main document, our group generally only plays games with 3 to 5 players, since 2-player games can be quite boring. Thus, the conventions are not optimized for play with only 2-players.
* With that said, it is possible to use the Hyphen-ated convention framework to also play 2-player games. While not commonly done, it is still perfectly functional.
* This document provides some extra conventions that are used by our group while playing 2-player games.

### The Flush Clue (A Slot 1 Color Clue)

* In a non-2-player game, it is permissible to use a color clue to save a slot 1 card. In this situation, the player who received the clue would then have a *Locked Hand*.
* However, this is not legal in a 2-player game. Players must use a number clue if they want to give a *Save Clue* to a slot 1 card.
* Thus, color clues that are focused on slot 1 are always *Play Clues*. This is referred to as a *Flush Clue* in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary *Play Clue*.
* Note that *Flush Clues* do not apply to black color clues that could be touching a black 3 or a black 4.
