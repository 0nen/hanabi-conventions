# Hanabi Conventions for The Hyphen-ated Group

<br />

## Introduction & Purpose

[Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) is a fantastic cooperative card game of logic and reasoning. Our group, started by a guy named Hyphen-ated, gets online games going regularly on [Hanabi Live](https://hanabi.live). Everything doesn't always go perfectly, but we strive to constantly improve. Naturally, we have also built up a set of conventions that we all agree upon at the beginning of the game so that it is easier to understand what everyone else is doing. As the list of conventions got longer, we wanted to make sure that everything was completely documented in an official capacity.

Are you looking to start playing games with my group? Fantastic - we are always looking to welcome new players. Take 5 minutes and go over the [beginner strategies](#beginner-strategies) below.

Have you found your way here from the Internet? That's fine too - you can use this document to cherry-pick strategies for your own group, or even adopt the whole convention framework if you want. We enjoy talking to other Hanabi players, so make sure to say hi in the [Hanabi Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp) as well. (Discord is a voice and text chat application that you can run in a browser.)

Note that while Hanabi is a 2 to 5 player game, our group generally only plays games with 3 to 5 players, since 2-player games can be quite boring. Thus, this document doesn't really apply to 2-player games; separate conventions are probably necessary for optimized play in that game type.

## Level 1 - Beginner Strategies

### Single Focus

* When we clue a card, we refer to that card being "touched" by the clue.
* If multiple cards are touched by a clue, only ONE card is the focus of the clue. Nothing is implied about the extra cards (beyond that they will be useful at some point in the game, which follows from *Good Touch Principle*).
* Thus, a clue cannot be both a *Save Clue* and a *Play Clue* at the same time; either it is one or the other.

### Save Clues

* If a player's chop card is clued, even if other new cards are introduced, the focus of the clue is on the chop.
* All clues that touch the chop have to be treated as potential *Save Clues*. Some common types of *Save Clues* are listed below.
* Players will use both color and number clues to perform *Save Clues* - always look to see if there is a card in the discard pile that "matches" the clue you were given to the card on chop.
* From *Save Principle*, if you can determine that the card on your chop does NOT need to be saved, then it must be a chop-focus *Play Clue* instead.

### 5 Saves (On Chop)

* Since there is only one copy of each 5, all of the 5's need to be saved so that they won't be discarded.
* Always save a 5 with a number clue instead of a color clue. Otherwise, it will look like a *Play Clue* (or potentially a *Save Clue* on some other critical card).

### 2 Saves (On Chop)

* Even though there are two copies of each 2, we agree that they are so important that we must save them in a manner similar to 5's.
* Similar to saving 5's, always save a 2 with a number clue instead of a color clue.
* *Save Principle* takes priority over *Good Touch Principle*. This means that you can violate *Good Touch Principle* and duplicate a 2 in the situation where a 2 is on chop and needs to be saved.
* Note that players are only allowed to perform a *2 Save* on a 2 not visible in other people's hands.
  * The one exception to this is if the same 2 is on two people's chops at the same time. In that situation, players are allowed to save whichever one they want with a *2 Save*.

### Play Clues

* We are very strict with what we clue - we don't just randomly clue cards in the hand.
* So if a card is touched as the focus of the clue, and it is not on chop, then that card is playable!

### Delayed Play Clues

* When you receive a *Play Clue*, it does NOT necessarily mean that you can play that card immediately. Look around the table for other ALREADY CLUED cards that might be related to the card that you got the *Play Clue* on. If there are any, you must wait for them to be played.
* For example, if Alice was clued about a bunch of 1's and then Bob is then clued about a 2, Bob should WAIT for Alice to play all of her 1's first BEFORE playing the 2.
* In other words, treat all *Play Clues* as potential *Delayed Play Clues*.

### Cluing 1's

* If you need to clue a single 1, it is better to do it with a color clue than a number clue. This is because it allows them to potentially clue other 1's on the table.

### Playing Multiple 1's

* If one or more 1's in your hand are clued, you should assume that they are ALL playable. (This ONLY applies to 1's, and follows from *Good Touch Principle*.)
* We agree that playing 1's at the beginning of the game is a special case - you should always play your 1's from oldest to newest.
* However, freshly drawn 1's should always be played before any 1's that were present in the starting hand. (This applies even if one of the clued 1s was on chop.)

### The Early Game (Beginner Section)

* The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the *Mid-Game*.
* The general goal of the *Early Game* is to extend it for as long as reasonably possible. Thus, everyone agrees that they MUST "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* before discarding. (There are no cards in the discard pile yet, but *Save Clues* still need to be given to all of the 5's on chop and all of the 2's on chop that are not present in someone else's hand.)
* In the *Early Game*, you can do a special move called a *5 Stall*; see below.
* That covers the basics. Some more edge-case specifics that you don't need to know right now are listed in *The Early Game (Intermediate Section)*.

### The 5 Stall (Cluing Off-Chop 5's)

* Normally, you are only allowed to give a *Save Clue* to a 5 if it is on chop. So if you use number 5 to clue a 5 that is NOT on chop, then it will typically look like a *Play Clue* on that 5 (or some other advanced strategy).
* As a special rule, in the *Early Game*, you ARE allowed to clue number 5 as a *Save Clue* to off-chop 5's. Doing this is just interpreted as a "stall" clue and that you are trying to extend the *Early Game* for a little bit longer.
* However, you are ONLY allowed to do this if there is nothing else to do, meaning that all of the "normal" *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* have been extinguished.
* Normally, a *5 Stall* is only done in the *Early Game*. However, you might see someone give a *5 Stall* in the *Mid-Game* if they are in a special situation where they are not allowed to discard.

### When to Discard

* In general (not just in the *Early Game*), discarding is a last resort. If you have known playable cards in your hand, you are expected to play them before discarding. Furthermore, if there are good play clues to give, you are expected to make them before discarding.
* Thus, if there are more urgent things at hand, you can defer saving important cards on someone else's chop if you see they have playable cards or even a good *Play Clue* to give.

### Fix Clues

* Normally, every clue that is given is either a *Save Clue* or a *Play Clue*. One small exception to this is a *Fix Clue,* which is attempting to "fix" an impending misplay.
* *Fix Clues* are often needed when a duplicate card is touched. (For example, when a red 2 is clued in Player A's hand, and the other red 2 is clued in Player B's hand.) Cards are not normally duplicated (which follows from *Good Touch Principle*), but sometimes someone makes a mistake, or a sequence of particular cards makes duplicating necessary.
* In such a situation, because of *Good Touch Principle*, the players with the duplicate cards will assume the identity of their cards to be something else and may go on to misplay those cards. Thus, it is the team's responsibility to fix the problem and intervene before this happens.
* **A clue cannot be a *Play Clue* and a *Fix Clue* at the same time.** If you receive a *Fix Clue* and it touches other ancillary cards, none of them are necessarily playable; the primary point of the clue is to fix the impending misplay.
* Usually a *Fix Clue* will "fill in" the card to explicitly make it known that the card is unplayable or duplicated. However, it is also possible to perform a *Fix Clue* just by cluing the card again. For example:
  * Alice clues Bob number 1 and it touches three 1's.
  * Bob successfully plays two 1's.
  * Before Bob can play the 3rd 1, Alice clues Bob number 1 again, and it re-touching the remaining 1.
  * Now it is Bob's turn. Since he was going to play the 1 already without Alice doing anything, the clue must have some other meaning. Thus, it is a *Fix Clue*: the remaining 1 is bad, and Bob can safely discard it.

### Prompts

* Imagine that you have a card in your hand that has a clue on it, but the full identity of the card is currently unknown. In this situation, you are supposed to just keep the card in your hand and continue to discard unclued cards.
* If someone gives a *Play Clue* to a card that is currently unplayable, and the "in-between" card matches the clued card in your hand, then they could be telling YOU to play the clued card. This is called a *Prompt* because it is "prompting" you to play a card that you would have otherwise held on to.
* For example, in a 3-player game:
  * All the 2's have been played on the stacks.
  * Alice clues a red 4 in Cathy's hand as a *Play Clue*.
  * Bob has a card in his hand with a red clue on it, but no number information.
  * Since Bob can see that the red 4 is supposed to play right now, he must have the red 3. So the unknown red card in his hand must be red 3, and he can safely play it.
* If a player is *Prompted* and there are multiple cards in the hand that the *Prompt* could apply to, they should play the left-most. (This follows from *Left-Most Playable Principle*.) For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Similar to the last example, Bob is *Prompted* for a red 3.
  * Bob has three different cards clued as red in slots 2, 3, and 4.
  * Since all 3 cards are equally likely to be red 3, Bob should choose to play the slot 2 card as red 3 since it is the left-most.
* If a player is *Prompted* and they play the left-most card and it was not the matching card, then they should continue playing clued cards until they find the matching card. (They are promised that they have the matching card somewhere in their hand.)
* In multi-color variants, *Prompts* apply to the card with the most positive information. For example, in a 3-player game:
  * Similar to the last example, Bob is *Prompted* for a red 3.
  * In slot 1, Bob has a card with only a red clue on it.
  * In slot 2, Bob has a card with a red clue and a 3 clue on it.
  * Since slot 2 has more positive information, Bob should choose to play slot 2 as red 3.
* The *Chop Move* is a special move that is covered later on. *Chop Moves* touch cards with an "invisible clue". Note that *Prompts* do NOT apply to *Chop Moved* cards. When fulfilling a *Prompt*, players should skip over the *Chop Moved* card and play something else.

### Finesses

* If someone gives a *Play Clue* to a card that is currently unplayable, then they could be telling YOU to play a card. Normally, this would indicate a *Prompt*. But, what if you have no clued cards in your hand? Or, what if you have no clued cards that apply to the situation?
* In this situation, you should blindly play your left-most unclued card. Then, the other player will know that the clued card directly matches the blind-play, and will play it. By doing this, the team will have gotten 2 plays with only 1 clue, which is very efficient. This is called a *Finesse*.
* For example, on the first turn of a 3-player game:
  * Alice clues Cathy red, which touches her red 2.
  * Next, it is Bob's turn. Bob sees that Cathy has been signaled that she has the red 1, and she will go on to misplay this card.
  * If Alice is not making a mistake, something must be in Bob's hand to make the red 2 playable. This must be a *Finesse*, so he blindly plays his left-most card and it is the red 1.
  * Next, Cathy plays her red 2.
* **Note that *Prompts* take priority over *Finesses*!** Do not blindly play your left-most card if the situation can apply to any of the clued cards in your hand.
* *Finesse Position* is the position that a player's left-most unclued card is in. Notice that even if a player's *Finesse Position* moves around, it is still possible to *Finesse* them. For example, on the first turn of a 4-player game:
  * Alice clues Cathy red, which touches two red cards on slot 1 and slot 2.
  * Cathy assumes that the slot 1 card is red 1.
  * Next, Bob clues Donald blue, which touches a blue 2.
  * Cathy assumes that this is a *Finesse* and that she must have a blue 1.
  * Now, it is Cathy's turn. Blind-playing the blue 1 is more important than playing the red 1.
  * Normally, the *Finesse Position* would be the left-most card. However, since Cathy's slot 1 and slot 2 card are already clued, Cathy's *Finesse Position* card has shifted down to her slot 3. Thus, she must blind-play the blue 1 from slot 3.
