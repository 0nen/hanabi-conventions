# Hanabi Conventions for The Hyphen-ated Group

<br />

## Introduction & Purpose

[Hanabi](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98778/hanabi) is a fantastic cooperative card game of logic and reasoning. Our group, started by a guy named Hyphen-ated, gets online games going regularly on [Hanabi Live](https://hanabi.live). Everything doesn't always go perfectly, but we strive to constantly improve. Naturally, we have also built up a set of conventions that we all agree upon at the beginning of the game so that it is easier to understand what everyone else is doing. As the list of conventions got longer, we wanted to make sure that everything was completely documented in an official capacity.

Are you looking to start playing games with the group? Fantastic - we are always looking to welcome new players. Take 5 minutes and go over [the beginner's guide](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Beginners.md) so that you can get up to speed with the basics.

Have you found your way here from the Internet? That's fine too. Feel free to [cherry-pick strategies for your own group](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions/blob/master/Reference.md), or even adopt the whole convention framework. We enjoy talking to other Hanabi players, so make sure to say hi in the [Hanabi Discord server](https://discord.gg/FADvkJp) as well. (Discord is a voice and text chat application that you can run in a browser.)

Note that while Hanabi is a 2 to 5 player game, our group generally only plays games with 3 to 5 players, since 2-player games can be quite boring. Thus, our strategies don't really apply to 2-player games; separate conventions are necessary for optimized play in that game type.
