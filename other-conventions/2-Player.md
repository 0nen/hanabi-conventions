# 2-Player Conventions for the Hyphen-ated Framework

<br />

### Introduction

* As stated in the main document, our group generally only plays games with 3 to 5 players, since 2-player games can be quite boring. Thus, the *Hyphen-ated Conventions Framework* is **not optimized for play with only 2-players**.
* With that said, it is possible to use the Hyphen-ated convention framework to also play 2-player games. While not commonly done, it is still perfectly functional, and it is almost always possible to get a perfect scores with expert players.
* This document provides some extra conventions that are used by our group while playing 2-player games.

### No Priority

* *Priority Prompts*, *Priority Finesses*, and so forth are all "turned off".

### One-Away Saves

* In non-2-player games, *Save Clues* must be given to cards that are on chop.
* In 2-player games, *Save Clues* can **also** be given to cards that are 1-away from chop. This gives players the ability to save 2 critical cards in a row.

### No 5's Chop Move

* The *5's Chop Move* convention is "turned off". Any 5 that is clued one-away from chop will just look like a normal *One-Away Save*.

### First Turn Stalls

* On the very first turn of the game, if a known-unplayable card is clued, then it should be treated as a *Save Clue* (instead of a *Self-Finesse*).
  * Players are allowed to use this ability even if there are other playable cards in the hand.

### Second Turn Stalls

* If a *Save Clue* was given to a chop card on the first turn of the game, then the next player is not allowed to discard. They must instead give a give a stall clue. (Otherwise, they are allowed to discard.)
* In a *Second Turn Stalling* situation, if a known-unplayable card is clued, then it should be treated as a *Save Clue* (instead of a *Self-Finesse*), similar to a *First Turn Stall*.

### The Flush Clue (A Slot 1 Color Clue)

* In non-2-player games, it is permissible to use a color clue to save a slot 1 card. In this situation, the player who received the clue would then have a *Locked Hand*.
* However, this is not legal in a 2-player game. Players must use a number clue if they want to give a *Save Clue* to a slot 1 card.
* Thus, color clues that are focused on slot 1 are always *Play Clues*. This is referred to as a *Flush Clue* in order to disambiguate it from a more ordinary *Play Clue*.

### The Scream Push (Anxiety with a Chop Move)

* If a player performs a *Scream Discard Chop Move* when the team is at 0 clues, it will generate a clue for the next player. Normally, the next player is supposed to *Chop Move*, and then give a *Stall Clue*. (They must give a *Stall Clue* just in case they have 2 critical cards in a row. If they do, the next player will *Scream Discard Chop Move* again.)
* However, the above situation does not make sense if the first *Scream Discard* **locks** the next player. This is because if the next player gives a *Stall Clue*, then the team would be back to 0 clues again, and there would never be any way for the player who performed the *Scream Discard* to ever clue anything else.
* This situation should be treated the same as *Anxiety* - even though there is 1 clue available, the locked player **has** to play something to keep the game going.
* If nothing else in their hand makes sense to play, then the locked player should blind-play the *Chop Moved* card.
