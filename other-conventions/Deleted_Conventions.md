# Deleted Conventions in the Hyphen-ated Framework

<br />

## Introduction

As we evolve our convention framework, sometimes we decide to delete existing "moves" or strategies in order to simplify things. And other times, new strategies that we come up with will conflict with older, existing strategies, so we must retire the older ones. This is a short lies of some retired strategies.

<br />

### Critical 4 Bluff

* Building on the *3 Bluffs* convention, it is ALSO possible for a card that initiates a *Bluff* to be a copy of any of the 4s that are critical (meaning that the other copy is in the discard pile or it is a black 4).
* This convention was deleted because it was hardly ever used and it increased complexity.

### Promise Bluff

* Typically, we are only allowed to *Bluff* with cards that are 1-away (normal *Bluff*) or a 3 (*3 Bluff*) or a critical 4 (*Critical 4 Bluff*). However, *Bluffs* can also be performed with cards that are 2 away if the true intermediary card exists on someone's *Finesse Position*. Doing such a move is essentially like doing a *Bluff* and a *Finesse* at the same time, with one component of each. This is called a *Promise Bluff*, because it promises the true one-away card in addition to being a *Bluff*.
* *Promise Bluffs* take priority over *Double Bluffs*; the person after the first blind-player will assumes that it is a *Promise Bluff* since they will see the true connecting card. And since that player does not blind-play their *Finesse Position* card, the player with the promised card can know to mark their hand accordingly.
  * As the receiver of the clue that initiates a *Promise Bluff*, it may be ambiguous as to what exactly the connecting card is, if it exists. As long as there is at least one candidate on someone's *Finesse Position*, then you have to assume a *Promise Bluff* over a *Double Bluff*.
* *Promise Bluffs* also take priority over *Layered Finesses*. This isn't normally an issue, since it is rare to actually to perform a *Layered Finesse* from *Bluff Position*, but it is worth mentioning.
* This convention was deleted because it was too rare to be worth the additional cognitive overhead. It also prevents some *Double Bluffs* from occuring.

### Reverse Misplay Chop Move

* Sometimes, a *Misplay Chop Move* will not immediately misplay because of circumstances similar to *Focus Inversion*, meaning that there is:
  * negative clues present on the card
  * historical / contextual information about the card (derived from moves that teammates performed earlier on in the game)
* In such a scenario, the clue will look like a *Reverse Finesse* and then next person will misplay their *Finesse Position* card.
* After the misplay, the person who received the clue is to treat it like a normal *Misplay Chop Move*, and chop move all the cards to the right of the clued card.
* This convention was deleted since it was never used.
