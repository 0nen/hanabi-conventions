## Introduction

This document is written for people who have a bunch of games on [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) and may be interested in playing some games with my group on [Hanabi Live](https://www.hanabi.live). Since my group uses some advanced conventions, this document should be a quick guide to get BGA players up to speed.

Why bother branching out from Board Game Arena into the the unknown? In order to properly answer that question, here's a short introduction on the differences between BGA and Hanabi Live. It should explain why, at the very least, you might want to dabble on both platforms. If you are already convinced, you can skip this section.

<br />

### Board Game Arena

Board Game Arena is the most popular place to play Hanabi online and it has players online during all hours of the day. As you probably know, it is really easy to hop into a quick 2-player game. Even though you will often be playing with complete strangers, most people on the site play with the same basic conventions, so little coordination is needed. And everyone is generally quite friendly!

Board Game Arena also has an ELO system, which insulates the expert players from the newbies. As you move up the ranks, you will start to get games with the same players, which also allows you to get to know everyone in the community a bit more intimately. What could be better?

#### The Interface

Unfortunately, BGA isn't perfect. The user interface is functional, but really leaves a lot to be desired:
* There is an in-game replay feature, but using it is frustrating. Once you initiate a replay, you are stuck watching the movie until it reaches the present, with no ability to pause, and no ability to move back and forth at will.
* There is no ability to see negative clues. You can keep track of them via memory, but this is quite cumbersome to do perfectly. Using negative clues is essential to playing at a high-level.
* There is no ability to mark notes on a card. It may sound silly to players who have been trained to remember everything, but having the ability to quickly and easily record contextual information really takes the game to another level. On BGA, if you want to make notes, you have to resort to jotting them down in a separate program.
* And a bunch of minor things:
  * No ability to see the cards touched by the last clue.
  * No distinction for playing cards blind (or discarding clued cards).
  * A ton of delay and super slow animations after making a move.
  * No customizable time controls.
  * Only the 3 most basic variants.
  * And no "shared replays" for reviewing!

#### The Lack of Reviewing

Besides the problems with the user interface, there is another big disadvantage with BGA: no reviewing.

Since there are so many players on the site, a general culture has emerged where once a game is over, players will typically just jump into the next game with the next player. Of course, this doesn't always occur, and there may be some lively post-game discussions from time to time. But this is the exception rather than the norm. In a way, it makes sense: why bother giving other players tips or have a discussion after the end of the game when you may not ever play with that player again? It's just more practical to move on.

Of course, this problem is compounded by the terrible replay system. Even if players wanted to hop on a voice call together and go through a game to analyze certain key moments, the replay system is just not condusive to the task. Often times, you need to stare at the exact turn for a while in order to come up with the best move. And to do that with the clunky replay system involves refreshing the page over and over.

<br />

### Hanabi Live

Hanabi Live is a modern website that fixes all of the interface issues with BGA. While there are some random players who play on the site, I would say that the majority of games are played by people in my group, the "Hyphen-ated group". We play in a manner similar to how BGA players play, but with a lot more "special moves" thrown in.

More importantly, when Hyphen-ated group members play together, we typically review every single game in a voice chat (using the free [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) web/desktop application). By doing this after every game, it accelerates the process of synchronizing everyone's strategies and playstyle to ensure that we are all on the same page. And it accelerates the process of making everyone really good at Hanabi, because people get the chance to learn from mistakes that they never would have known that they made. It's just a lot of fun - reviewing the game can be more fun than actually playing the game.

Overall, there are both good and bad things about Hanabi Live when compared to BGA.

#### The Bad

The best aspect of Board Game Arena is the large number of players. And the ELO system, for better or worse, does a pretty good job of motivating players to keep playing. The fact of the matter is that there will never be as many players on Hanabi Live as there are on BGA - not even close. On Hanabi Live, often times there will be no-one will be around when you are interested in getting a game going. So, that can be an annoying part of playing here. (For this reason, some people in our group also dabble on BGA!)

Another potentially bad aspect of playing with my group is the complexity involved. We are very welcoming of noobs, but I won't deny that it is going to be a longer journey to become an expert in our group than it would be to be an expert at BGA. And if you're already comfortable with the BGA conventions, it might just be too frustrating to experiment with different ways of doing things.

So, for both of these reasons, playing with my group probably won't appeal to the more casual Hanabi players who just want to play a game or two every now and then.

#### The Good

What is the flipside of not having very many members? Better cohesion, aided by discussion. When you can get a crew together, your games will probably be more fulfilling and in-depth than on Board Game Arena.

What is the flipside of more conventions and more complexity? First off, it raises the skill ceiling. Hanabi throws plenty of tricky situations at you, and you only have a limited amount of tools to solve them. By adding some conventions, it can be like adding additional tools to the toolbelt. For expert players, by empowering them with more tools, it increases the total ways in which they can solve problems, making the game take on a new layer of beauty. But even for intermediate players, it can be very fun to gain the powers to make your teammates blind-play cards from their hands in new and exciting ways. =)

If you are a Hanabi perfectionist, you'll be happy: the goal is to always play a perfect game with no mistakes. If you are a Hanabi theorist, you'll be happy: if someone thinks up a better way to do things, we are always open to refining our conventions by adding new ones (or deleting existing ones). If you're a Hanabi enthusiast, you'll be happy: we strive to push the game to the limits.

But maybe that's going overboard. Maybe a better description is that we are just a bunch of people who play Hanabi occasionally and really like it, and anyone is free to join us.

#### Duality

As a concluding note, I should say that I am NOT necessarily advocating that anyone completely "converts", like it is some kind of religion. Rather, feel free to experiment and play on both platforms! It is absolutely possible to switch back and forth between convention frameworks. You can think of this as similar to a bilinguial person switching from Spanish to French - you don't necessarily have to choose between the two.

<br />

## Convention Changes (Beginner)

If you're reading this far, you'll want to know some of the basic differences between the the *BGA convention framework* and the *Hyphen-ated convention framework*. Fear not - it isn't so bad once you play a few games.

<br />

### What's the Same?

* Below, you'll find a whole bunch of scary stuff about how my group does things differently from the way you know and love.
* Before you get overwhelmed, I think it is important to communicate right from the start that **most stuff will be the exact same as you are used to on BGA**.
* Stuff like giving *Finesses*, giving *Bluffs*, paying attention to see that no-one on the team discards anything important, using good teamwork - all of this stuff is stuff you are already used to and it will carry over more or less exactly.

### A Note on the Conventions Themselves

* On BGA, the "rules" or conventions by which people play are largely unwritten, and can change from game to game. But you'll almost certainly know what they are after having played a bunch of games.
* In my group, the rules are [completely documented](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions). Yeah, don't bother reading the full document now, but note that **you can use it as a quick reference** in case you ever need to look up something specific.
* Why do this? Having a strongly defined set of rules cuts out most silly post-game arguments on how an ambiguous-looking clue should be interpreted. Instead, it encourages discussion on finding the most efficient moves and strategies within a shared framework, which is much more productive.

### 2 Saves - Added Always

* The *2 Saves Convention* is when someone clues number 2 and it touches a 2 on chop. Even if it touches some other 2, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is currently playable - the point of the clue was to save one or more 2's.
* On BGA, *2 Saves* are typically "turned on" in 2-player games, but turned off with 3 or more players.
* In my group, *2 Saves* are ALWAYS turned on, even in 5-player games.
* Why do this? Having this convention eliminates 100% of "bottom-deck" losses to 2's.

### Clue Focus on Retouched Cards - Changed

* When multiple cards are "touched" by a clue, it typically only means to play one card. We call that card the *focus* of the clue.
* On BGA, the focus can be on either card. But most often, the focus is on the existing card that is "filled in" by the clue.
* For example, in a Rainbow game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a card in her hand clued with number 2.
  * Bob clues Alice red, filling in the 2 with red and also introducing a brand new card on her newest slot.
  * Alice plays the "filled-in" card as the focus of the clue, and holds on to the other red card for later.
* On BGA, clues given similar to the one in the example above can ALSO mean to play both cards, depending on the situation. (e.g. Alice plays red 2 and then plays red 3.)
* In my group, **the focus of the clue is always on the brand new card introduced**. In the previous example, Alice should play her newest card as either red 2 or rainbow 1. She is promised nothing about her other red card, meaning that it can be either red 2 or rainbow 2.
* Why do this? Having this convention makes it extremely clear exactly what card is being talked about in almost all situations.

### Chop Focus - Added

* It is common for a *Play Clue* to introduce several cards in the hand. So, which one is playable?
* On BGA, the system is dead simple: (almost) always play the left-most card.
* In my group, it is a two step process:
  * If one of the new cards introduced was on the chop, then it is a *Chop Focus Play Clue*.
  * Otherwise, it is a *Left-most Play Clue*.
* Why do this? Notice that having this convention compliments *Finesses*. Our group has a wide variety of *Finesses* and *Bluffs*, so it is easy to "get" fresh cards, but more difficult to "get" cards on chop.

### Color Saves - Changed

* One problem in Hanabi is when a clue lights up your chop card for the first time. How do you know whether it is a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*?
* On BGA, the system is that number clues mean *Save Clues*, and color clues mean *Play Clues*.
* In my group, both number AND color clues can be used to save cards.
* ANY clue that touches the chop has to be treated as a *Save Clue* first and foremost. If you can rule out a *Save Clue* interpretation, then you know that it is a *Chop Focus Play Clue*.
* Why do this? It allows us to choose the exact clue type that would avoid touching duplicated cards.

### Early Save Play Clues - Deleted

* On BGA, a timing system is used such that if a card is saved "early" before it really needs to be saved, then the clue must not be a *Save Clue* at all, and instead transforms into a *Play Clue*. Let's call this a *Early Save Play Clue*.
* In my group, there is no such timing system. ALL clues that look like *Save Clues* are *Save Clues*, even if they are early.
* Why do this? It allows for better *Discard Modulation*.

### The Early Game - Added

* On BGA, you don't want to discard on the first few turns. But after that, you can pretty much discard whenever you want.
* In my group, we have a thing called the *Early Game*. The *Early Game* is defined as the period of time before someone discards for the first time. When they do, they initiate the *Mid-Game*.
* In the *Early Game*, everyone agrees that they MUST "extinguish" all of the available *Play Clues* and *Save Clues* before discarding.
* Why do this? It prevents a certain percentage of "bottom-deck" losses by having one-away cards on chop stick around for a little longer.

<br />

## Convention Changes (Intermediate)

Ok, so you've made it this far. The changes so far probably sound pretty strange, but at least most of the core stuff is still the same. Before reading further, you'll probably want to play a few games with us to get a feel for how the basics work. Beyond the basics, there are some other changes as well.

<br />

### Bluff Restriction - Changed

* On BGA, it is possible to perform a *Bluff* on whomever you want. You just have to be careful that it won't be too confusing.
* In my group, it is ONLY permissible to *Bluff* the very next player. We call this being in *Bluff Seat*. Alice is in *Bluff Seat* for Bob, Bob is in *Bluff Seat* for Cathy, and so forth.
* Why do this? It allows for a powerful move called a *Layered Finesse*, which is covered further on.

### Chop Moves - Added

* On BGA, if a card does not have an explicit clue on it, players may forget that they know ancillary information about it (beyond having pure negative clues).
* In my group, we never forget. Thus, we have several specific types of clues cause a *Chop Move*.
* A *Chop Move* is like an invisible clue that is applied to the chop card. *Chop Moved* cards are never discarded, similar to how you would never normally discard a card that already has a clue on it. Thus, once a *Chop Move* happens, the player's chop will move one slot over to the next unclued card.

### Scream Discard Chop Moves - Changed

* On BGA, if you discard with a known playable card, it is usually a signal to the next person that is a bad situation and that they have something important on chop. So, the next person will give some stall clue, and then the important card in question will be explicitly saved by someone else on the next go-around of the table. On BGA, there is no name for this move.
* In my group, we give this move a name - the *Scream Discard*. This is because when you do it, it is like you are screaming at the next player.
* Furthermore, in my group, we don't bother wasting a clue to explicitly save the card. The player is expected to *Chop Move* the card forever.
* Why do this? Well, it is obviously more efficient to not have to waste clues on critical cards that are not currently playable anyway.

### The 5's Chop Move - Added

* On BGA, if you clue a 5 that is one away from chop, then it is either a stall clue or a *Play Clue* on the 5, depending on the situation.
* In my group, we assign a special meaning to number 5 clues that introduce a brand new 5 that is exactly one-away from chop. You guessed it - it's a *Chop Move*.
* You can use this special power to save two cards with one clue. It is very powerful in order to save a critical card that is followed by a 5. Or, you can even use it to save a non-critical but-still-useful card.
* The *Chop Move* interpretation will always take precedence over a *Play Clue* interpretation, so you have to be careful about that. Of course, at the end of the game, when it would be pointless to *Chop Move* anything, then it will just look like a *Play Clue* instead.

### The Order Chop Move - Added

* In the beginning of the game, it is common for two or more 1's to get clued in someone's hand.
* On BGA, people typically play their 1's from oldest to newest. However, you are allowed to play the 1's in whatever order you want, and no-one really pays too much attention.
* In my group, we pay attention. If you don't play your 1's from oldest to newest, it *Chop Moves* the next person.
* Why do this? You get to save 5's (and other valuable stuff) "for free" without having to waste a clue. Yeah, it's good.

### The Priority Finesse - Added

* Often times, a player will have two or more playable cards in their hand and have a choice as to which one to play.
* On BGA, it is typical for people to play the cards that lead into teammate's hands. However, you are ultimately allowed to play your cards in whatever order you want, and no-one really pays too much attention.
* In my group, we pay attention.
* For example:
  * Alice has a red 1 and a blue 1 to play.
  * Bob has a red 2 to play and is waiting for Alice to play the red 1.
  * Alice is expected to play the red 1. (The red 1 is said to have *Priority*.) Instead, Alice plays the blue 1.
  * Thus, someone on the team is PROMISED to have the blue 2, so they should blind-play it, similar to if a *Finesse* was performed.
* You can also do *Priority Prompts* and *Priority Bluffs*. It works suprisingly well in a variety of situations.
* Why do this? It's a no-brainer and something that BGA hasn't figured out yet.

### Double Discard Avoidance (DDA) - Changed

* *Double Discarding* is when two players discard the same thing in a row (say, a red 4) and it causes a perfect score to be lost.
* In BGA, there is some basic strategies to avoid *Double Discards* from occurring. Firstly, you are generally allowed to "early save" the card by cluing it directly. Secondly, you can indirectly solve the problem by planning a line where it sets up one of the players to give an obvious clue. Both of these are viable strategies to solve the problem.
* In my group, we are not allowed to do the first strategy - we are ONLY allowed to save cards that have already been discarded. (Or 5's, or 2's.)
* And in my group, there is no need to do the second strategy, because we play with a separate solution: a *Hard Double Discard Avoidance Convention*.
* In this context, "hard avoidance" means that a player will avoid *Double Discarding* at all costs. If he is in danger of *Double Discarding*, then he will give any clue at all to avoid it, even if it is a complete waste of a clue.
* Why do this? It narrows the possibilities of what *Save Clues* can be, which is quite useful. Furthermore, it eliminates the silliness involved in dancing around a *Double Discard* situation - players just simply don't have to worry about it anymore and can focus on always giving the highest efficiency clue for the situation.

<br />

## Convention Changes (Advanced)

These are conventions that we don't typically turn on for new players, but we do use regularly in high-level games.

<br />

### 3 Bluffs - Added

* On BGA, cards that are touched to initiate a *Bluff* are known to be one-away cards from being playable.
* In my group, we arbitrarily agree that any card used to initiate a *Bluff* can be either a one-away card OR a 3.
* To be clear, you are allowed to *3 Bluff* with either color or number.
* This is one of the more arbitrary and tricky conventions that we have, so it will take a few games to get used to.
* Why do this? It allows us to get 2-for-1 clues in situatinos where only a 1-for-1 was available. Furthermore, it allows us to mitigate a good percentage of "bottom-deck" losses to 3's.

### Layered Finesses - Added

* On BGA, you generally can't do a *Finesse* that gets a big chain of cards to blind-play one after the other.
* In my group, you are allowed to perform a *Finesse* that promises a specific card (as long as you are not in *Bluff Seat* for that person). Once promised, the player will continue to play cards in their hand from left to right until they find the promised card.
* For example, in a 4-player game:
  * Alice clues red to Donald as a *Play Clue* on a red 2.
  * This promises that someone has the red 1.
  * Cathy knows that she has the red 1, because she doesn't see anyone else have the red 1.
  * Cathy blind-plays a blue 1 (from slot 1).
  * Cathy knows that Alice is in *Bluff Seat* for Bob. Thus, it cannot be a *Bluff* on her; Cathy knows that she must actually have the red 1, and that a *Layered Finesse* is occurring.
  * On her next turn, Cathy tries to blind-play the red 1 (from slot 2), but it is really the blue 2.
  * On her next turn, Cathy tries to blind-play the red 1 (from slot 3), but it is really the blue 3.
  * On her next turn, Cathy blind-plays red 1 (from slot 4).
  * Donald plays red 2.
* We call this a *Layered Finesse* because the intended *Finesse* blind-play target is "layered" behind other playable cards.
* Why do this? It's pretty awesome. =)

<br />

## A Concluding Note

Reading the stuff in this document will get you nearly all of the major tools that you will need to play with my group. And that's good enough - you can and should stop reading now and learn everything else you need to know from direct experience and post-game reviews.

The reason I say this is that there is a common misconception of newcomers to the group. Newcomers are shown [the main conventions document](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions) and assume that in order to play effectively, they have to read and memorize the entire thing. This can't be further from the truth. A lot of the sprawl is enumerating special situations that hardly ever come up in a typical game. The document is really meant to be used as a reference, not to be read from start to finish, so it is important to keep that in mind.
