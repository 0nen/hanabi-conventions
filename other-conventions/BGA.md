## Introduction

Hello there, fellow Hanabi enthusiast. Do you love Hanabi? We would love for you to join us at [Hanabi Live](https://www.hanabi.live), a place for players who are seeking high-level play and a strong community. This document is written for people who have a bunch of games on [Board Game Arena](https://en.boardgamearena.com/) and may be interested in learning some of the more advanced conventions used by some of the players at Hanabi Live. But first, a short introduction on the differences between BGA and Hanabi Live, and why you should bother with, at the very least, dabbling on both platforms.

<br />

### Board Game Arena

Board Game Arena is the most popular place to play Hanabi online and it has players online during all hours of the day. As you probably know, it is really easy to hop into a quick 2-player game. Even though you will often be playing with complete strangers, most people on the site play with the same basic conventions, so little coordination is needed. And everyone is generally quite friendly!

Board Game Arena also has an ELO system, which insulates the expert players from the newbies. As you move up the ranks, you will start to get games with the same players, which also allows you to get to know everyone in the community a bit more intimately. What could be better?

#### The Interface

Unfortunately, BGA isn't perfect. The user interface is functional, but really leaves a lot to be desired:
* There is an in-game replay feature, but using it is frustrating. Once you initiate a replay, you are stuck watching the movie until it reaches the present, with no ability to pause, and no ability to move back and forth at will.
* There is no ability to see negative clues. You can keep track of them via memory, but this is quite cumbersome to do perfectly. Using negative clues is essential to playing at a high-level.
* There is no ability to mark notes on a card. It may sound silly to players who have been trained to remember everything, but having the ability to quickly and easily record contextual information really takes the game to another level. On BGA, if you want to make notes, you have to resort to jotting them down in a separate program.
* And a bunch of minor things:
  * No ability to see the cards touched by the last clue.
  * No distinction for playing cards blind (or discarding clued cards).
  * A ton of delay and super slow animations after doing literally anything.
  * No customizable time controls.
  * Only the 3 most basic variants.
  * And no "shared replays" for reviewing!

#### The Lack of Reviewing

Besides the problems with the user interface, there is another big disadvantage with BGA: no reviewing.

Since there are so many players on the site, a general culture has emerged where once a game is over, players will typically just jump into the next game with the next player. Of course, this doesn't always occur, and there may be some lively post-game discussions from time to time. But this is the exception rather than the norm. In a way, it makes sense: why bother giving other players tips or have a discussion after the end of the game when you may not ever play with that player again? It's just more practical to move on.

Of course, this problem is compounded by the terrible replay system. Even if players wanted to hop on a voice call together and go through a game to analyze certain key moments, the replay system is just not condusive to the task. Often times, you need to stare at the exact turn for a while in order to come up with the best move. And to do that with the clunky replay system involves refreshing the page over and over.

### Hanabi Live

Hanabi Live is a modern website that fixes all of the interface issues with BGA. While there are some random players who play on the site, I would say that the majority of games are played by people in my group, the "Hyphen-ated group". We play in a manner similar to how BGA players play, but with a lot more "special moves" thrown in.

More importantly, when Hyphen-ated group members play together, we typically review every single game in a voice chat (using the free [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) web/desktop application). By doing this after every game, it accelerates the process of synchronizing everyone's strategies and playstyle to ensure that we are all on the same page. And it accelerates the process of making everyone really good at Hanabi, because people get the chance to learn from mistakes that they never would have known that they made.

#### The Bad

The best aspect of Board Game Arena is the large number of players. And the ELO system, for better or worse, does a pretty good job of motivating players to keep playing. The fact of the matter is that there will never be as many players on Hanabi Live as there are on BGA - not even close. Often times, no-one will be around when you are interested in getting a game going, which can be an annoying part of playing here. (So, for this reason, some people in our group also dabble on BGA!)

Another potentially bad aspect of playing with my group is the complexity involved. We are very welcoming of noobs, but I won't deny that it is going to be a longer journey to become an expert in our group than it would be to be an expert at BGA. And if you're already comfortable with the BGA conventions, it might just be too frustrating to experiment with different ways of doing things.

So, for both of these reasons, playing with my group probably won't appeal to the more casual Hanabi players who just want to play a game or two every now and then.

#### The Good

What is the flipside of not having very many members? Better cohesion, aided by discussion. If you always wanted to know what a teammate was thinking at a critical point in the game, then you're in luck: when there ARE people around to play, your games with my group will probably be more fulfilling and in-depth than on Board Game Arena. 

What is the flipside of more conventions and more complexity? First off, it raises the skill ceiling. Hanabi throws plenty of tricky situations at you, and you only have a limited amount of tools to solve them. By adding some conventions, it can be like adding additional tools to the toolbelt. For expert players, by empowering them with more tools, it increases the total ways in which they can solve problems, making the game take on a new layer of beauty. But even for intermediate players, it can be very fun to gain the powers to make your teammates blind-play cards from their hands in new and exciting ways. =)

If you are a Hanabi perfectionist, you'll be happy: the goal is to always play a perfect game with no mistakes. If you are a Hanabi theorist, you'll be happy: if someone thinks up a better way to do things, we are always open to refining our conventions by adding new ones (or deleting existing ones). If you're a Hanabi enthusiast, you'll be happy: we strive to push the game to the limits.

But maybe that's going overboard. Maybe a better description is that we are just a bunch of people who play Hanabi occasionally and really like it, and anyone is free to join us.

#### Duality

As a concluding note, I should say that I am NOT necessarily advocating that anyone completely "converts" from BGA to my group, like it is some kind of religion. Feel free to dabble on both platforms! It is absolutely possible to switch from one convention set to another. You can think of this as similar to a bilinguial person switching from Spanish to French - you don't necessarily have to choose between the two.

## Conventional Changes - Beginner and Intermediate

If you're reading this far, you'll want to know some of the basic differences between the the *BGA convention framework* and the *Hyphen-ated convention framework*. Fear not - it isn't so bad once you play a few games.

<br />

### A Note on the Conventions Themselves

* On BGA, the "rules" or conventions by which people play are largely unwritten, and can change from game to game. But you'll almost certainly know what they are after having played a bunch of games.
* In my group, the rules are [completely documented](https://github.com/Zamiell/hanabi-conventions). Yeah, don't bother reading this document now, but **you can use it as a quick reference** in case you ever need to look up something specific.
* Why do this? Having a strongly defined set of rules cuts out most silly post-game arguments on how an ambiguous-looking clue should be interpreted. Instead, it encourages discussion on finding the most efficient moves and strategies within a shared framework, which is much more productive.

### 2 Saves - Added Always

* The *2 Saves Convention* is when someone clues number 2 and it touches a 2 on chop. Even if it touches some other 2, it doesn't necessarily mean anything is currently playable - the point of the clue was to save one or more 2's.
* On BGA, *2 Saves* are typically "turned on" in 2-player games, but turned off with 3 or more players.
* In my group, *2 Saves* are ALWAYS turned on.
* Why do this? Having this convention turned on eliminates 100% of "bottom-deck" losses to 2's.

### Clue Focus on Retouched Cards - Changed

* When multiple cards are "touched" by a clue, it typically only means to play one card. We call that card the *focus* of the clue.
* In BGA, the focus can be on either card. But most often, the focus is on the existing card that is "filled in" by the clue.
* For example, in a Rainbow game:
  * Red 1 is played on the stacks.
  * Alice has a card in her hand clued with number 2.
  * Bob clues Alice red, filling in the 2 with red and also introducing a brand new card on her newest slot.
  * Alice plays the "filled-in" card as the focus of the clue, and holds on to the other red card for later.
* In BGA, clues given similar to the one in the example above can ALSO mean to play both cards, depending on the situation.
* In my group, **the focus of the clue is always on the brand new card introduced**. In the previous example, Alice should play her newest card as either red 2 or rainbow 1. She is promised nothing about her other red card, meaning that it can be either red 2 or rainbow 2.
* Why do this? Having this convention turned on makes it extremely clear exactly what card is being talked about almost all of the time.

### Chop Focus - Added

* It is common for a *Play Clue* to introduce several cards in the hand.
* On BGA, the system is dead simple: always play the left-most card.
* In my group, it is a two step process:
  * If one of the new cards introduced was on the chop, then it is a *Chop Focus Play Clue*.
  * Otherwise, it is a *Left-most Play Clue*.
* Why do this? Notice that having this convention turned on compliments *Finesses*. Our group has a wide variety of *Finesses* and *Bluffs*, so it is easy to "get" fresh cards, but more difficult to "get" cards on chop.

### Color Saves - Added

* One problem in Hanabi is when a clue lights up your chop card for the first time. How do you know whether it is a *Play Clue* or a *Save Clue*?
* In BGA, the system is that number clues mean *Save Clues*, and color clues mean *Play Clues*.
* In my group, both number AND color clues can be used to save cards.
* ANY clue that touches the chop has to be treated as a *Save Clue* first and foremost. If you can rule out a *Save Clue* interpretation, then you know that it is a *Chop Focus* play clue.
* Why do this? It allows us to choose the exact clue type that would touch valuable cards, or AVOID touching duplicated cards. (We call this *Good Touch Principle*, by the way.)

### Early Save Play Clues - Deleted

* In BGA, a timing system is used such that if a card is saved "early" before it really needs to be saved, then the clue must not be a *Save Clue* at all, and instead transforms into a *Play Clue*. Let's call this a *Early Save Play Clue*.
* In my group, there is no such timing system. ALL clues that look like *Save Clues* are *Save Clues*, even if they are early.
* Why do this? It allows for better *Discard Modulation*.

<br />

## Conventional Changes - Advanced and Expert

These are conventions that we don't typically turn on for new players, but we do use regularly in high-level games.

<br />

### 3 Bluffs - Added

* On BGA, cards that are touched to initiate a *Bluff* are known to be one-away cards from being playable.
* In my group, we arbitrarily agree that any card used to initiate a *Bluff* can be either a one-away card OR a 3.
* To be clear, you are allowed to *3 Bluff* with either color or number.
* This is one of the more arbitrary and tricky conventions that we have, so it will take a few games to get used to.
* Why do this? It allows us to get 2-for-1 clues in situatinos where only a 1-for-1 was available. Furthermore, it allows us to mitigates a good percentage of "bottom-deck" losses to 3's.
